{"prompt": "Boston (CNN) -- After seven weeks of colorful witnesses and rancorous testimony, the jury began deliberations Tuesday in the trial of alleged crime boss James \"Whitey\" Bulger. Eight men and four women on the federal court panel have the monumental task of processing testimony from drug traffickers, extortion victims, gangsters, families of alleged victims and shooting victims, along with more than six hours of closing arguments. Bulger is accused of 19 killings and 13 counts of extortion and money laundering during a 20-year \"reign of terror\" that defined South Boston from the early '70s through 1995, when Bulger fled Boston. Jurors deliberated for six hours Tuesday before court was suspended for the day shortly after 4:30 p.m. ET. Deliberations are scheduled to resume Wednesday at 9 a.m. Jurors will have to decide if the government has proven its case and if Bulger is guilty of the alleged crimes \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\" \"You must decide which evidence to believe and which witnesses are true. You can believe some, or all, or none,\" U.S. District Court Judge Denise Casper told the jurors Tuesday, adding a cautionary instruction for government witnesses who have entered into plea deals for immunity and lesser sentences. Casper advised that jurors weigh the potential that these witnesses \"may have a motive to make up stories.\" Simultaneously, jurors are advised not to draw inferences from a witness's guilty plea. Plea deals for gangsters . In their closing arguments Monday, defense attorneys attacked the credibility of gangsters who became star witnesses for the prosecution, testifying under immunity after they learned Bulger was an informant for the FBI for nearly two decades. Prosecuting attorney Fred Wyshak on Monday defended the government's unsavory plea deals with those gangsters, three of whom implicated Bulger in the 19 murders and various acts of extortion. \"The government didn't choose them, Bulger chose them,\" Wyshak said. \"The only thing worse than making a deal with (former hit man) John Martorano would have been not making a deal with John Martorano.\" Wyshak said the government \"held its nose and made the deal.\" Prosecutors called 63 witnesses during the course of the trial, with the defense bringing only 10 to the stand. Martorano testified for both sides, making a total of 72 witnesses over 35 days. As he presented his closing argument Monday, Wyshak called Bulger one of the most \"vicious, violent and calculating criminals to ever walk the streets of Boston.\" The prosecution took close to three and a half hours for its closing. The defense took over two and a half hours to make its case, then the prosecution had the final word in a rebuttal. Defense attorney J.W. Carney summed up his case by questioning the credibility of prosecution witnesses, some of whom came to court with extensive criminal resumes and who had worked out deals with the government in exchange for testifying against Bulger. \"If you cannot say in your deliberation that I personally can believe (prosecution witnesses) beyond a reasonable doubt, then the government cannot prove its case about the alleged murders,\" Carney told the jury. \"The government is buying the testimony of these witnesses. The currency used here (is) how much freedom someone is going to get. What the government can pay the individual is the individual's freedom,\" Carney continued. Earlier, Wyshak said Bulger and his partner \"plotted, they schemed, they robbed they murdered together, they were also informants together.\" Prosecutors contend Bulger was an FBI informant who used protection from rogue agents as he continued his life of crime. Defense attorneys have argued Bulger was not an informant, and that FBI bungling was key in the case. \"If there is one thing you heard during this trial, it's how secretive that relationship is,\" Wyshak said to the jury Monday. \"The last thing a criminal wants ... is for people to know he's an informant.\" But he also said that it \"doesn't matter whether or not Bulger is an FBI informant when he put the gun to the head of Arthur Barrett and pulled the trigger.\" Arthur \"Bucky\" Barrett died after being shot in the head in 1983. \"It's not about whether or not the FBI in Boston was a mess,\" he said. \"... It's about whether or not the defendant is guilty of crimes charged in the indictment.\" Families of the victims were in court every day of the trial. The wife of one of the victims shouted \"You're a coward!\" The defense rested its case Friday with no rebuttal from the government. In its weeklong presentation, Bulger's lawyers tried to cast doubt on who killed two of the 19 victims, both of them women. The defense also attempted to shift the blame onto the FBI, specifically agents who either did nothing or did too little to prevent several killings. Defense attorneys tried to convince the jury that Bulger was not an FBI informant, a notion prosecutors called \"ludicrous\" in light of his FBI informant card and a 700-page file loaded with \"tips\" on rival gang members. In closing arguments, defense attorney Hank Brennan told jurors why he thinks the government has made Bulger's informant status the crux of its case. \"Think about why it's so important. If it's not an issue, why do they keep bringing it up?\" Brennan asked. Brennan explained that other than to \"embarrass\" his client, the government using its claim that Bulger was an informant to cover up years of corruption. \"If he's not an informant, think of the liability,\" he said, recounting instance after instance in which government officials as high as strike-force attorneys in the Justice Department protected Bulger throughout his criminal career. A number of retired FBI agents and supervisors took the stand during the trial, many testifying that they believed Bulger should have been shut down as an informant because he wasn't providing any useful information. The agents said they never pressed the issue because apparently FBI headquarters felt Bulger was useful in taking down the New England Mafia. Grisly murders . It took prosecutors 90 minutes to detail the 19 murders Bulger is accused of, showing photos of each of the victims and the crime scenes. Bulger is not charged with delivering the fatal blow in all of the murders, but is charged with participating as part of a racketeering conspiracy. Wyshak called Bulger \"the leader of a very wide-ranging, broad organization,\" who is culpable for his co-conspirator's crimes. But Wyshak made clear Bulger was the alleged triggerman in some cases, recalling testimony from Bulger's partner, Steve \"The Rifleman\" Flemmi, about the murder of John McIntyre, whose remains were exhumed from a shallow makeshift grave in 2000. McIntyre had begun cooperating with the government on the shipment of weapons to the Irish Republican Army and 36 tons of marijuana imported into Boston Harbor. \"It's Arthur Barrett all over again, held at gunpoint, chained to the kitchen chair, interrogated,\" Wyshak said. Flemmi said he was holding McIntyre's body while Bulger was trying to strangle him with a rope, but the rope was too thick. After that didn't work, McIntyre practically begged for a bullet after Bulger asked him if he would \"like one in the head,\" according to Flemmi. Flemmi testified as one of the government's star witnesses, and he said that he saw Bulger strangle the two women. The defense team, however, presented evidence that Flemmi had the greater motive to kill the women -- his girlfriend and his stepdaughter. Bulger's attorneys release photos designed to show his softer side . The girlfriend, Debra Davis, was about to leave him for another man. The defense recalled Martorano, who testified that Flemmi admitted he \"accidentally strangled\" the 26-year-old woman. Flemmi acknowledged he lured Davis to a home but says Bulger strangled her because she was talking too much and had become a liability. Wyshak recalled testimony that Bulger always needed to take a nap after strangling or shooting his victims to death. In talking about the murder of Paul McGonagle, Wyshak said Bulger's former cohorts testified that whenever they passed the Neponset River, where McGonagle's remains were exhumed in 2000, Bulger said, \"'Drink up, Paulie.' That's the level of humanity that this defendant is operating at. ... And every time he goes by there it's 'Drink up, Paulie.'\" Victim's mother warned FBI about an impending murder . 'Bulger: I didn't get a fair trial' Bulger was a fugitive for more than 16 years, after a crooked FBI agent told him in December 1994 he was about to be indicted on federal racketeering charges. The FBI tracked him down and arrested him 2011 in Santa Monica, California, where he had been living with his girlfriend under an alias. Bulger never took the stand, despite repeated hints from his lawyers throughout trial he would testify. In fact, Bulger seemed to want to testify, and when questioned about it by the judge, Bulger called his decision a \"choice made involuntarily.\" He claimed he had been given immunity for his crimes by the former head of New England's Organized-Crime Strike Force, Jeremiah O'Sullivan, now deceased. Bulger, who lost his temper several times during the trial, appeared angry, shaking his finger at the judge and claiming he was \"choked off from making an adequate defense.\" \"I didn't get a fair trial. This is a sham. Do what ya's want with me,\" Bulger said. Man arrested in death of alleged Bulger extortion victim ."}
{"prompt": "A transsexual who had a £10,000 sex change on the NHS to become a woman now wants the taxpayer to foot the bill for a further £14,000 of surgery so she can become a man again. Chelsea Attonley, 30, who was born a boy and called Matthew, said she now finds being a woman 'exhausting', is tired of putting on make-up and wearing heels, and now accepts that she should always have stayed a man. Chelsea said she had struggled with her identity while growing up in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, and as a child she would dress up in women's clothes. In her twenties she became a drag queen known as Miss Malibu, drawing on glamour model Katie Price's look for inspiration. Scroll down for video . Chelsea Attonley, 30, who was born a boy and called Matthew, had a £10,000 sex change on the NHS to become a woman. She now wants the taxpayer to foot the bill for a further £14,000 of surgery so she can become a man again . An initial bid for a sex change to become a woman was turned down by a doctor, sending Chelsea into a spiral of depression, she said. But then the former drag queen, who copied Jordan's style by wearing a blonde wig, mini skirts and stilettos, had a chance meeting with her idol in a nightclub in 2007. The glamour model told her to 'go for it' and her words inspired Chelsea to return to her GP and push once again for the gender reassignment surgery, costing £10,000. But now, seven years after surgery to become a woman, Chelsea wants to go back to being a man - and wants the taxpayer to foot the bill. Chelsea, who lives on welfare benefits, told a magazine yesterday she finds dressing and acting as a girl 'exhausting' and feels she has never been fully accepted as a real woman. She is aiming to have a breast reduction on the NHS and painful gender reassignment surgery to give her back a penis at a total cost of £14,000. Chelsea, who changed her name by deed poll from Matthew in 2008 after a £5,000 boob job in Thailand partly funded by benefit money, says she gradually began having doubts about the sex change . Chelsea, now living in London, said: 'I have always longed to be a woman, but no amount of surgery can give me an actual female body and I feel like I am living a lie. 'It is exhausting putting on make-up and wearing heels all the time. Even then I don't feel I look like a proper woman. 'I suffered from depression and anxiety as a result of the hormones too. 'I have realised it would be easier to stop fighting the way I look naturally and accept that I was born a man physically.' Chelsea, who spoke on ITV's This Morning earlier this year about Katie Price's encouragement, says she does not feel guilty about asking the taxpayer to pay for her reversion. 'Now I have decided I want to live as Matthew, I am desperate to have my FF-cup boobs removed,' she said. 'I can't afford to have them done privately, so I am hoping to have the op on the NHS. 'I can't work at the moment because I am too upset after what I have been through. 'I am considering having penis reconstruction too. I don't feel bad about the NHS paying for the surgery as I don't consider it a choice. 'I need to have these operations for the sake of my mental health. I am lucky enough to live in a country where there is free health care.' Chelsea, who changed her name by deed poll from Matthew in 2008 after a £5,000 boob job in Thailand partly funded by benefit money, says she gradually began having doubts about the sex change. She said: 'I thought the surgery would make me feel complete, but it didn't. 'I knew deep down that, even though I had had surgery, I had still been born a man. 'But I tried my best to block out my feelings.' Chelsea said living as a woman is exhausting. 'No matter how much make-up I put on or how I dressed, I knew people would not know me as a real woman. Chelsea, now living in London, said: 'I have always longed to be a woman, but no amount of surgery can give me an actual female body and I feel like I am living a lie' 'It was draining to constantly think about how to walk and speak like a girl. 'I was fighting a losing battle. When people found out about my past, they treated me like a liar and a fake. I suffered from anxiety and depression.' She said she lost the support of her mother when she died from a heart attack. She said : 'I could not keep up the act of pretending to be a woman any more. It was making me miserable. 'I had to go back to living as Matthew.' She said she had always struggled with her identity while growing up in Chesterfield, Derbyshire. As a child she would dress up in women's clothes, and in her twenties she became a drag queen known as Miss Malibu . Chelsea has already had testosterone injections to begin her transition to becoming a man again. She has also had testosterone injections to stimulate hair growth and has cut his hair. She added: 'If people criticise me for wanting treatment on the NHS, it does not bother me. 'I know I need these changes to make me happy and no one should deny me that.' The TaxPayers' Alliance yesterday insisted the NHS should not be expected to pay out again. Research director Alex Wild said: 'The NHS must prioritise crucial frontline services over ridiculous vanity operations. 'This whole saga has simply cost far too much. If the Health Service is to be properly funded, this sort of waste must be cut out.'"}
{"prompt": "LUANDA, Angola (Reuters)  -- Holden Roberto, a central figure in Angola's struggle for independence from Portugal, died on Thursday in the capital of Luanda, the state newspaper said on Friday. Holden Roberto, left,  a father of Angola's independence, shown in 1975. He died August 2, 2007, in Luanda. Roberto founded the National Front for the Liberation of Angola (FNLA) in the early 1960s and presided over the party until his death at age 84, the Jornal de Angola said. It said he died of an illness but did not give details. Roberto was one of the leaders who signed accords that led to the country's independence in 1975. Angola then fell into a civil war spanning nearly three decades that killed around 1 million people and displaced millions more. Roberto, who moved to Paris at independence, came back to Angola to take part in elections in 1992 which were followed by political turmoil. The presidential poll was aborted after a disputed first round, prompting a return to the conflict between the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) and government forces. The war ended in 2002. The FNLA is Angola's third-biggest opposition party after UNITA, with five members in parliament. Angola, which is enjoying an oil boom, high economic growth and widespread foreign investment, is expected to hold parliamentary and presidential elections in 2008 and 2009, the first national polls in some 15 years.

An American couple in Texas who officially became the parents of two Congolese orphans in June are still fighting to meet their children and have no idea when their family may finally be whole. Laura and Greg Richardson became heartbroken and desperate when the African nation halted all adoptions to America in September before Josias and Mercy could make the trip to the states. Officials in Congo say they fear the kids sent abroad could be mistreated, while the well-off and God-fearing parents of four biological children want the 15- and 18-month old boy and girl out of the war ravaged nation as soon as possible.

'It’s just . heartbreaking,' Laura Richardson told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. 'We . are watching our children grow up in pictures.

'We are legally their parents,' Laura Richardson said. 'It’s irreversible.' But . parents or not, the Richardsons are only able to help raise and nurture . the Congolese children through the prayers and with the hope their . government's dictate will soon be reversed.

While . the children are currently living together at an orphanage, children in . the country face daunting odds just to stay alive on a daily basis. The .

Head injuries: Anthony Owen died a week after being found unconscious just 20 yards from his home . The family and friends of a gifted surgeon killed outside his home reacted furiously yesterday when a teenager charged over his death escaped prosecution. Anthony Owen, 68, was found sprawled on the ground next to his car and died in hospital six days later from head injuries. A 17-year-old boy was arrested, questioned by detectives and charged with manslaughter. But yesterday the Crown Prosecution Service dropped the case, saying a pathologist’s report supported the boy’s claim that he hit the cancer specialist in self defence. Without any witnesses, lawyers said there was little prospect of a conviction. Mr Owen’s sister, Aileen Hepplewhite, 53, said: ‘To say that dropping the prosecution is a step in the wrong direction is an understatement. ‘It’s hard to describe how I feel. Obviously as a family we are disappointed no one  will face trial but that hardly conveys the feelings we have about everything that  has happened.’ A neighbour said: ‘It’s terribly upsetting. I can’t begin  to imagine how difficult it must be for the family. It’s just typical of our justice system. It’s an absolute disgrace.’ Another resident added: ‘This teenager claimed self-defence and with no evidence or witnesses it seems there’s nothing the law can do. ‘It’s a terrible shame and awful for Anthony’s family that they will not see justice done.’ The incident took place in March in the prosperous Cheshire village of Hale. Afterwards three teenagers were seen riding away from Mr Owen’s £750,000 thatched house on BMX bikes. Three suspects were arrested and questioned before one – the 17 year old – was charged with manslaughter. A respected oncologist, Mr Owen began his medical career in 1968 and was awarded a fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1973. He was semi-retired but had been working as a locum at Wrexham Maelor Hospital in North Wales up until his tragic death. Well to do: Mr Owen's home in Hale Village, . Widnes, Cheshire, where he lived alone. The devout Roman Catholic, who had . never married, had lived in Hale for more than 30 years, nursing his . mother Anne, herself a retired doctor, until she died in 2003. Laurie Northern, who attended church . with Mr Owen, described him as ‘the type of man who would stand up for . himself’. And residents living in the village have complained that . teenagers from a nearby housing estate cause frequent problems. Rachael Barber, senior prosecutor at . the CPS, said: ‘After very careful consideration of all the evidence in . this case, including new evidence which has recently been presented, I . have decided not to continue the case against a 17-year-old youth in . connection with the death of Anthony Owen. ‘The youth was originally charged with . manslaughter on the basis that there was  a reasonable suspicion he had . committed the offence and there were grounds for  believing that the . continuing investigation would provide further evidence to support the . prosecution. Mr Owen, a devout Catholic, had lived in the quiet village of Hale for more than 30 years and was well-liked by his neighbours . ‘Since then, new evidence has been . presented, including the final pathologist’s report which indicates that . the injuries to the victim were consistent with the victim suffering . one blow to the face. ‘The pathologist’s report provides . supporting evidence for the defendant’s version of events: that he was . acting in self defence. This expected further evidence has not provided . us with a stronger case to meet the test of sufficient evidence for a . realistic prospect of conviction.’ She said that without witnesses . prosecutors would not be able in court to rebut the defendant’s claim . that he was acting in self defence. ‘In addition, we took into account . that he had come  forward voluntarily to give his account and that he . has no previous convictions,’ she added. Two other youths, aged 14 and 17, who were also at the scene, were earlier released without charge due to insufficient evidence. Another neighbour said: ‘I sincerely . hope the lad feels some remorse over the death of a wonderful man and a . gifted surgeon who saved and extended so many lives.’ The mother of the teenage boy, whose . identity is protected by law, said: ‘We have been advised by our . solicitor not to make any comment until after the coroner has held an . inquest.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons."}
{"prompt": "By . Wills Robinson . and Sam Webb . Tragic: Paul Wilson, 38, died after suffering a severe allergic reaction to a takeaway meal which is believed to have contained peanuts . Police investigating the death of a father who had a severe allergic reaction to nuts have arrested two men believed to work at the takeaway which served him a meal containing peanuts. Paul Wilson, 38, died after eating a curry from a takeaway which is believed to have contained peanuts. The bar manager was found unresponsive in the living quarters of the Oak Tree Inn, in the village of Helperby, North Yorkshire in January. Police have now confirmed that two men - a 51-year-old and 38-year-old - were arrested in connection with his death and have since been released on bail while the investigation continues. The takeaway has been named locally as the Indian Garden in the nearby small market town of Easingwold. Paul Horsman, the manager of The York pub in Easingwold was one of the last people to see Mr Wilson alive. The pair were friends and Mr Wilson would often stop for a drink at The York on his days off. On the night before he died Mr Wilson was waiting for a taxi to take him home with the curry at the pub. Mr Horsman, who has run the pub for 26 years, said: 'It was a shock to find out someone I was talking to 12 hours before had died. 'He came here regularly on his days off. The taxi driver who took him home came round the next day and told me. 'The CID had spoken to him because it was the last number on (Mr Wilson's) mobile.' Mr Wilson died after eating a takeaway from Indian Garden in Easingwold, local sources reported . Closed for business: A note in the window of Indian Garden . He said he was told that two men were taken from the restaurant by officers, adding: 'Indian Garden has been closed for at least a fortnight. 'I heard the police came at 9.30 one Monday morning. They took out bags and various items.' A North Yorkshire Police spokesman said: 'Officers are working with Trading Standards to establish the circumstances surrounding Mr Wilson’s death.' North Yorkshire County Council confirmed . Trading Standards were assisting police in their enquiries but would not . comment further. The death of bar manager Mr Wilson, who had a young son, was linked to anaphylactic shock from peanuts found in a meal. Speaking after his death, a representative of pub company Provenance Inns, owners of the Oak Tree Inn paid tribute to Mr Wilson. In a statement, they said: 'We are all distraught over loss of Paul, who was a fun and kind-hearted chap - the perfect guy to be working in a pub. Local: The York pub, where Mr Wilson had a drink while waiting for the taxi that would take him home to eat his takeaway curry . Accommodation: The bar manager was found unresponsive in the living quarters of the Oak Tree pub in Helperby, North Yorkshire . 'He fitted in very quickly and had a great many friends. Paul will be much missed by everyone.' There are only about ten recognised deaths from food allergy in the UK every year. Mr Wilson’s passing came ahead of the . Government introducing new food information regulations later this . year, which stipulate eating establishments must provide detailed . information about any allergens contained in their food. About one in 100 Britons are allergic to peanuts. It is the most common type of food allergy, which people rarely grow out of. For unknown reasons, studies have shown a sharp rise in peanut allergies over the last 20 years. Attempts to find a cause have proved inconclusive. Many studies have suggested unborn children whose mothers eat peanuts are less likely to develop an allergy, although this is disputed. If you are allergic to nuts, you will not have a reaction the first time you come into contact. At first, your immune system reacts and prepares to fight. The second time, a full allergic reaction occurs. Symptoms often start quickly, within minutes of coming into contact with a nut - or even a fraction of a nut. Those severely allergic will fall into anaphylaxis, requiring an adrenaline injection straight away, which will give them time to get to hospital. Curry . sauces from restaurants across the country are being urgently tested . after three deaths were linked to an allergic reaction from peanuts in . takeaways. Safety . chiefs fear a new food scandal with fraudsters adulterating expensive . almond powder used to thicken sauces with cheap ground peanuts – a move . which can prove fatal if the meal is eaten by someone suffering from a . peanut allergy. Connor Donaldson, 12, from Tyldesley, . Greater Manchester, and Derek Stephenson, 32, a gardener from Stanhope, . County ­Durham, have also died in separate cases. Some people suffer an . allergic reaction if they eat any type of nut, but others can safely eat . almonds and pistachios grown on trees and are only affected by peanuts, which are grown in soil. Under current legislation, eating establishments are legally obliged to provide information about allergens only if they are asked to by a customer. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has ordered councils to encourage restaurant owners to check their ingredients. New rules come into effect in December which will make the labelling of possible food allergens compulsory. A North Yorkshire County Council spokeswoman said the authority was set to launch an allergens awareness raising campaign ahead of the new legislation coming into force on December 13. Following Mr Wilson’s death, his parents Margaret and Keith asked for donations on a JustGiving page in memory of their son to be given to Allergy UK.

'All of these delicious looking meals and then Australia gets a meat pie?' questioned Kahlee Anderson. Others embraced the decision as a celebration of Australiana. 'We like football, meat pies, kangaroos and Holden cars,' said Mike Curran. AFC cup organisers even felt it needed to describe the composition of a meat pie, writing that it is a 'pie with a filling of meat and/or other savoury ingredients'. Japan: Star player Keisuke Honda's national dish was sushi . Saudi Arabia: Nasser Al-Shamrani's national dish was kabsa, a type of spiced chicken . Oman: Ali Al-Habsi's national dish was suwah, a lamb-based dish . Statistics, however, show the AFC may have done its research. Each Australian eats an average of 12 meat pies a year, according to Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) . That means the nation consumes some 270 million pies each year.

But the latest stunt by the 'world's strongest boy' has sparked outrage, with critics claiming his father is putting his son at risk of serious injury. Giuliano and his seven-year-old brother Claudiu first hit the headlines when videos showing their intense training regime went viral in 2010. The tiny muscle 'men' have been performing amazing acrobatic feats and lifting weights since they were toddlers. Scroll down for video . Showman: Giuliano Stroe, nine, has been called the 'world's strongest boy' thanks to his remarkable shows of strength . Preparation: Wearing only a pair of blue shorts, Giuliano prepares to show off his latest dangerous stunt - balancing on two green glass bottles . Up and away: The tiny Romanian strongman first lifts his feet off the ground and balances on his hands (left), before lifting himself up into the air thanks to his incredible upper body strength (right) Handstand: The nine-year-old elevates and extends fully in an eye-catching display. His parents have denied forcing him to train for hours and mother Ileana said of her sons: 'They have a natural ability for this, nothing is forced, it is what God intended for them' But the shocking latest photos - posted by their dad Iulian - showing Giuliano balancing on two bottles using only his hands have been criticised as extremely dangerous. The youngster is precariously balanced, and the pictures show that he could easily slip on the bottles which could smash and cause massive injury to his hands and face when he came crashing down. One user wrote: 'And what if the bottle cracks? What chance is there that he wouldn't get a serious injury on the way down?' A Facebook user called Paul Moktan wrote, 'This is idiotic, what if the bottle breaks', while another user called Victor Hammer wrote: 'You are destroying his body! Please, it's not OK for the kid.' On previous videos posted by the father, other uses have accused him of 'child abuse' But the criticism has been ignored by the family, and it is not the first time that the boy has been shown doing risky exercises. In a video posted recently, Giuliano is seen performing 25 push-ups on his hands on a horizontal bar and with his head down. His younger brother Claudio does the same exercise, but only manages to make 12 push-ups. Balance: The youngster is capable of extreme shows of strength and performs push ups while balanced on two glass bottles, which prompted criticism on social media . Dangerous: Giuliano performs push ups on the bottles, causing one social media user to comment: 'This is idiotic, what if the bottle breaks' Giuliano has already broken two world records for 90-degree vertical push-ups and another for holding on to a pole like a human flag. Claudiu soon followed suit, starting at the age of 18 months, and is already performing handstand push-ups on a bar and learning the same terrifying flag trick. Father Iulian, 38, was determined to make them famous and put them through a gruelling two hour regime each morning in Florence, in central Italy, where his family lived. His plans went awry and he was forced back to Romania, where he has now makes a living selling scrap metal and trading in the southern village of Icoana. But he has continued the rigorous training regime, promoting it on the boy's Facebook page which now has more than 3.6 million likes. Training: Giuliani's father Iulian, right, denies pressuring his sons into a gruelling training regime and insists they simply love to train .

Muscle man: Former boxer Iulian (left) has previously said he wants his children to become the strongest in the world . Although local authorities have protested against the father's attitude, they have so far failed to sanction him because they cannot prove he is harming the children.

{"prompt": "Ravi Bopara has leapt to the defence of Alastair Cook after England’s crushing one-day defeat by Sri Lanka in Colombo was followed by renewed demands for his resignation. Kevin Pietersen, Ian Botham and Michael Vaughan all called for Cook to quit after the Sri Lankans moved with embarrassing ease into a 2-0 lead in the seven-match series. But Bopara, whose enterprising half-century stood out in a sorry display, said Cook was not the only struggling batsman in England’s one-day side. In a formulation that has become familiar, Bopara insisted: ‘He’s quite a strong character. He’ll come out the other side.’ Ravi Bopara (right) has described England captain Alastair Cook as a 'fighter' who can prove doubters wrong . The statistics are beginning to stack up against Cook (second from right) with Bopara pictured on the far left . If England keep losing and Alastair Cook keeps failing, his position as one-day captain will come under serious pressure. If England do dispense with his services, expect Alex Hales to replace him as opener and Eoin Morgan to replace him as captain for the World Cup Down Under in February, even though the Irishman also looks out of form. Few doubt Cook’s mental strength. But his lack of runs and England’s faltering preparations for the World Cup, now less than three months away, appear to be a concern only to those outside the dressing-room. Cook’s scratchy 22 in 37 balls on Saturday meant he has scored only one half-century in 16 innings since guiding England to the final of the Champions Trophy on home soil in June 2013. And – with the surprising exception of Joe Root – that record compares unfavourably with the rest of the current top seven over the same period. In 16 innings since the Champions Trophy, Cook has averaged 29, with a lowly strike-rate per 100 balls of 71. Only Root averages fewer (27), but none of the top seven has scored more slowly than the captain . Bopara finds it easy to retain faith in a cricketer like captain Cook who has a career trait of resilience . Bopara had to try to prove his point again after being dropped by England for the home series against India . By contrast, Moeen Ali is averaging 43 with a strike-rate of almost 107, while Jos Buttler’s figures are 40 and 115. Even Ian Bell, whose place has been questioned while the likes of Alex Hales and James Taylor wait for their chance, has been scoring at 90 runs per 100 balls. Bopara, though, was toeing a loyal line. ‘One thing we must remember, it’s not just Alastair Cook who hasn’t scored over the past few games,’ he said. ‘There’s been a lot of us. ‘He is our captain. He’s done it in the past. I remember him scoring two hundreds on the bounce in the UAE. He can play, and I’m sure that form will turn around.’ Cook will have to do so without the help of batting coach Mark Ramprakash, who on Sunday night left the tour as per his part-time deal with the ECB. England’s top seven since the 2013 Champions Trophy, ordered by average . England captain Cook looks on after misfielding a ball during the second ODI against Sri Lanka . England have lost 15 of their 25 ODIs since they were beaten by India at home in the final of the Champions Trophy in June 2013. They have won just nine, with one no result. Asked about the views of Botham, Vaughan and Pietersen – who tweeted ‘Dear Alastair, if you care about England's chances this winter, pls resign and just concentrate on Test cricket... ‪#getHalesin’ – Bopara was philosophical. ‘Everyone’s entitled to their opinion,’ he said. ‘In English culture, we’re quite quick to jump on something that hasn’t gone right. What’s happened to Cook over the past year has definitely made him stronger. He smiles a lot more now than he ever did. I think he’s in a good place.’ Bopara himself may be in a better place than when England dropped him for the home one-day series against India at the end of the summer. He has begun this series with a pair of fifties, and worked out more quickly than his colleagues that Saturday’s pitch required careful accumulation – not the gung-ho strokeplay that scuppered England’s top order. ‘Getting dropped against India was a shock,’ he said. ‘I remember the phonecall quite clearly. I didn’t really want to tell anyone, to be honest. I was a little bit embarrassed. Cook (second from right) has overseen seven one-day international defeats in England's last eight matches . ‘I get dropped a lot, actually. I think I come back wiser every time, and a little bit more independent. That’s the key to playing cricket at this level: you’ve got to be very independent and not be so coach-driven.’ After being given a run at No 4 in 2012, Bopara’s role in the one-day side has been as a finisher, or a repairer of innings, from No 6 or 7. His natural gifts are well suited to both tasks, but he is clearly underwhelmed by the designation. ‘I’d like to bat a bit higher,’ he said. ‘It’s an OK role. It’s not a glorious role. You’re not quite a main batter or a main bowler. At Essex I play as a main batsman – that’s how I like to be viewed. But the role I’m given – there’s nothing I can do about it. ‘I could do with a little bit of help down the back end, I think. It would be nice to be batting with someone like Jos Buttler or Eoin Morgan.’ Right now, these are luxuries England may not be in a position to consider."}
{"prompt": "THE HAGUE, Netherlands (CNN) -- The International Criminal Court at the Hague issued an arrest warrant Wednesday for Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir for a five-year campaign of violence in Darfur. Al-Bashir waves to supporters in the sudanese capital,  Khartoum on Wednesday. It is the first arrest warrant ever issued for a sitting head of state by the world's only permanent war crimes tribunal. Bashir is charged with seven counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes. The warrant does not mention genocide, but the court may issue an amended warrant to include that charge later, ICC spokeswoman Laurence Blairon said. But Sudan's minister of information and communications said the country does not plan to cooperate with the \"white man's tribunal.\" Kamal Obaid said: \"Sudan perceives those decisions as an insult directed at (Sudan's) nationalism and sovereignty ... The government relies on the strong will of the people and on a national consensus not seen before and (stands) by decisions taken by its council of ministers and parliament and restates what it always confirmed.\" Speaking on Sudanese TV, he added: \"The Security Council and international community must bear full responsibility toward any escalation produced by those clumsy decisions.\"  Watch a pro-Bashir rally in Sudan » . Five of the counts against Bashir are for crimes against humanity and include murder, extermination, forcible transfer, torture, and rape, Blairon said. The other two are for war crimes, for intentionally directing attacks against civilians and for pillaging. \"Bashir's official capacity as head of state does not exclude criminal responsibility or get him immunity,\" Blairon said in announcing the warrant. The ICC's chief prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, filed genocide charges against al-Bashir in July last year, accusing him of masterminding attempts to wipe out African tribes in the war-torn region with a campaign of murder, rape and deportation.  Watch more on the verdict » . The violence in Darfur erupted in 2003 after rebels began an uprising against the Sudanese government. To counter the rebels, Sudanese authorities armed and cooperated with Arab militias that went from village to village in Darfur, killing, torturing and raping residents there, according to the United Nations, Western governments and human rights organizations.  A man describes how he was told to rape children » . The militias targeted civilian members of tribes from which the rebels drew strength. Moreno-Ocampo told CNN's Nic Robertson last year that he had \"strong evidence that al-Bashir is committing a genocide.\" But Blairon said the evidence submitted to judges so far doesn't support that charge.  Watch Christiane Amanpour's reaction to the verdict » . \"In order to speak about a genocide, you need to have a clear intent that a person wishes to destroy, in part or as a whole, a targeted group, a specific group,\" Blairon said. \"In this specific case, the (judges of the) Pre-Trial Chamber 1 has not been able to find that there were reasonable grounds to establish the genocidal intent.\" Prosecutors may still return to the chamber if new evidence of genocide emerges, and the court may then decide to issue an amended warrant, she said. Moreno-Ocampo said Wednesday he would have to review the court's decision not to include genocide in the arrest warrant, but he pointed out it is possible to appeal. Al-Bashir bears responsibility for the crimes committed in Darfur, Moreno-Ocampo said last year, because he sat at the apex of the government. \"For such crimes to be committed over a period of five years and throughout Darfur, al-Bashir had to mobilize and keep mobilized the whole state apparatus; he had to control and direct perpetrators; and he had to rely on a genocidal plan,\" Moreno-Ocampo wrote as background for arrest warrant request. The Sudanese government has long rejected the authority of the ICC, saying Sudan is not a signatory to the court's creation so there is no legal obligation to turn al-Bashir over to the court.  Sudan: 'Process is unlawful' » . U.S. State Department spokesman Gordon Duguid issued a statement on the arrest warrant, saying \"the United States is strongly committed to the pursuit of peace in Sudan and believes those who have committed atrocities should be held accountable for their crimes.\" The statement urged all groups \"to exercise restraint in responding to this development and to ensure the safety and security of vulnerable Sudanese populations, international civilians, and peacekeepers on the ground.\" Germany and the UK both urged Sudan to cooperate with the ICC. \"We deeply regret that the government has not taken these allegations seriously or engaged with the court, and we repeat today our call for its cooperation,\" British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said. The ICC said the obligation to surrender al-Bashir falls on all countries that are also members of the U.N. Security Council and to \"any other state as may be necessary.\" And the judges have ruled that additional arrest warrants may be issued for Al-Bashir and served on any state as required, said court registrar Silvana Arbia. Al-Bashir is scheduled to attend an Arab summit in Doha, Qatar, later this month. Moreno-Ocampo said Wednesday that al-Bashir stands the chance of being arrested should he travel. \"The judges were clear: There is no immunity for head of states before the ICC,\" the prosecutor said. \"As soon as Omar al-Bashir travels through international air space, he can be arrested.\" \"Omar al-Bashir's destiny is to face justice,\" he added. \"It will be two months or in two years, but he will face justice.\" About 300,000 people have died in Darfur, the United Nations estimates, and 2.5 million have been forced from their homes. \"His victims are the very civilians that he, as a president, was supposed to protect,\" Moreno-Ocampo said. CNN's Nic Robertson contributed to this report."}

An unnamed man has sworn on behalf of socialite Taylor Stein that William Lauder, 53, offered him cash and a job in exchange for making 'false and misleading statements' about Stein. Litigation between Lauder and Stein has been unending since the 2007 birth of their daughter and has even seen Stein arrested for domestic battery after she punched her billionaire ex in the face. Bitter feud: Socialite Taylor Stein (left) and billionaire cosmetics heir William Lauder (right) are embroiled in years-long litigation that began after Stein had their baby in 2007 .

A drug offering hope to late-stage breast cancer sufferers was approved by the government yesterday. The Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of Kadcyla, which is said to work as a 'smart bomb' on a strain of the disease which is believed to effect one fifth of sufferers. It is a combination of the well-known Herceptin and a chemotherapy drug called DM1. Wonder drug? On Friday the Government approved Kadcyla, a new breast cancer drug which it is hoped can extend the lives of advance stage sufferers of the disease . DM1 is too powerful to go straight into the blood stream but Herceptin works as a carrier delivering it to the cancer cells directly. The drug has been proven effective on HER2-positive breast cancer, a protein which advances cancer growth, adding several months onto the life of many women who were facing death. It was trialled on 991 women with advanced stage HER2-positive breast cancer and found to extend their lives by and average of 5.8 months compared to standard chemotherapy. According to the FDA, 20 per cent of breast cancer sufferers suffer from HER2 protein breast cancer. Breast cancer is the second most deadly type of cancer among American women. This year estimates say 232,340 will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 39,620 will die as a result of the illness. Makers . of the drug, Genentech, put out a statement saying the drug will be . available in two weeks but NBC reports it is expensive at a cost of . $94,000 for a 10 month course. The company said it would help patients who couldn't afford to make the payments. 'People . who do not have health insurance, or who have reached the lifetime . limit set by their insurance company, might qualify to receive Kadcyla . free of charge,' it said in the statement. Hope: Genentech, the makers of Kadcyla, say the drug on average added almost 6 months onto the lives of advanced-stage breast cancer sufferers . The company say the release is the first of several cancer drugs which they are working on which adopt this 'smart bomb' approach . Chief medical officer and Head of Global Product Development, Hal Barron, said: 'Kadcyla is an antibody-drug conjugate representing a completely new way to treat HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, and it helped people live nearly six months longer. 'We currently have more than 25 antibody-drug conjugates in our pipeline and hope this promising approach will help us deliver more medicines to fight other cancers in the future.'"}

A neuroscientist who claimed to have fathered 58 children while running a 'one stop shop' insemination service preyed on three women desperate to become mothers by sexually assaulting them, a court was told. Professor Gennadij Raivich, 51, a perinatal neuroscientist at University College London, carried out home visits to women across the country - allegedly assaulting three of them during the insemination process. The academic from Holborn, London, told one victim she had to repeatedly perform oral sex on him to obtain the sperm samples, Blackfriars Crown Court heard. Raivich, who sometimes went by the pseudonym Frank Qualman, is also alleged to have told one woman her chances of becoming pregnant were increased if she orgasmed during the insemination process. The man would take a . 'donation kit' containing a DVD player - which he watched pornography . on - rubber gloves, a speculum and pipette to his visits, jurors heard. Raivich is only qualified as a doctor in Germany, has never practiced medicine in the UK and is not . registered with the General Medical Council, the prosecution said. His . service did not conform to the guidelines of the Human Fertilisation . and Embryology Authority, . the court was told. Raivich has pleaded not guilty to . assault by digital penetration in relation to the first victim, one count . of assault by penetration and sexual assault against another, and two counts of assault by penetration and two . counts of sexual assault on  a third. He . also denies two counts of sexual assault against the third woman on . January 31 last year and assault by penetration on the same date. The court heard how all the alleged victims heard about Raivich's service via an internet forum. Prosecutor Tom Wilkins said: 'Each . complainant in this case is a woman who met the defendant through an . internet forum dedicated to sperm donation. 'He provided a one stop shop for women who wanted semen. All were desperate to have a baby.' 'The defendant met these women in order to inseminate them. 'He took advantage of their desperation, his anonymity and informality by committing various types of sexual assaults upon them.' 'On the websites he advertises his . services as a sperm doner and represents himself as a: ‘Medical doctor . based in Central London’ providing a service called Intra-Cervical . Insemination or ICI.' The . first victim saw Raivich on February 27, 2012 when 'wholly gratuitously . and without warning' assaulted her the jury were told. 'Such was her desperation to have a baby she returned ten times to his Russell Square address.' Blackfriars Crown Court heard how Raivich told one alleged victim she had to give him oral sex repeatedly in order to get a sperm sample. He told another she was more likely to get pregnant if she orgasmed during the insemination process, the court heard . He persuaded his second victim to give him oral sex so he could provide the sample - a service that he called: 'Artificial Insemination Plus'. The prosecutor continued: 'She says she was faced with the ultimatum that unless she performed oral sex on him she would not get a donation. She was desperate for a baby and agreed.' Raivich also groped her between her legs during the sessions. Mr Wilkins continued: 'He told her an orgasm would help her conceive. 'She told him three or four times not to touch her there, but he went ahead regardless and now he says he can’t recall stimulating her in this way. 'He was not the altruistic donor, but someone who is sexually-motivated. 'She was desperate for a baby and returned a week later for a donation in return for performing oral sex on him and felt she had to put up with it, she had been trying for a baby for a year.' The third victim was visited by Raivich at her home in Great Yarmouth and on the second occasion sexually assaulted her, jurors heard. 'He lifted up her t-shirt and groped her breasts. He says he checked her breasts to test her fertility.' The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article."}
{"prompt": "It's been more than 20 years since the original cast of Saved By The Bell walked the halls of Bayside High School. But on Wednesday evening Mario Lopez - who played A.C. Slater on the popular 90s sitcom - was joined by his former co-stars for a reunion on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. The show's heartthrob was joined by fellow hunk Mark-Paul Gosselaar (Zack Morris), the beautiful Elizabeth Berkley (Jessie Spano) and Tiffani Thiessen (Kelly Kapowski), as well as Dennis Haskins (Principal Belding). Scroll down for video . Hooray! On Wednesday evening the former cast of Saved By The Bell reunited for a hilarious skit on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon . Brick phone: Gosselaar (right) is seen taking a phone call as he stands next to 'new student' Jimmy Fallon . Missing from the line-up was Dustin Diamond (Screech) and a Lark Voorhies (Lisa). Dustin is accused of stabbing a man during a bar fight on Christmas, while Lark has withdrawn from the limelight as she is reportedly battling bipolar disorder. During the evening Lopez took to Instagram to share behind-the-scenes snaps with his nearly 400,000 followers. Where was Screech? Dustin Diamond was recently charged with 'second-degree recklessly endangering safety, disorderly conduct and carrying a concealed weapon'; pictured in his mug shot (L) and in 1993 (R) Missing: Lark Voorhies who played Lisa (Screech's love interest) was absent from the reunion as she is reportedly battling mental illness, pictured in LA in May . In the photos, the 41-year-old Extra host barely looked a day older than his teenage self, wearing a pair of high-waisted bleached trousers and a bright blue short-sleeve shirt with black vintage print. Mario even showcased his former trademark hairstyle - curly locks with a mullet-like section in the back. In one of the pictures he is seen posing beside Gosselaar - who models spray-painted blonde hair. Flashdance? While in character for their skit, Mario busted out some impressive ballet moves . One on the way: Then, Tiffani Thiessen (Kelly Kapowski) appears and announces she's pregnant, showing off a baby bump. The actress is currently expecting her second child, a boy, with husband Brady Smith . She's preggers! Kelly arrives on the scene with some big news . Nothing has changed: Jessie confuses Slater with an emotional outburst . The Franklin & Bash actor, 40, also donned his respective character's wardrobe - khaki trousers, a blue print shirt and a salmon button-up shirt over top - for the realistic parody. In their hilarious skit the group of stars are  joined by a new Bayside High student - Jimmy Fallon. As Jimmy stands at his locker he begins talking with Gosselaar and soon the duo are joined by Mario dressed as Slater. Spinning for joy: Mario showed off his incredible physique in a leotard . Oh oh! The 'students' are then confronted by the school's principal Belding, played by Haskins . He walks in with a too-cool-for-school gait and greets them with, 'What's up, preppies?'. Team spirit: The five friends bonded as they discussed future plans . Hurrah! The parody came to a close as they all leaped for joy . The three guys begin discussing the upcoming 'big Valentine's Day dance' and who they're each bringing as a date. A short time later they are joined by Mario's former flame from the show, Berkley. Mario rips off his attire, revealing a skintight black leotard, as he performs an impressive ballet dance. High school sweethearts: Tiffani posted a photo with her former on-screen love on her Instagram (L) which proved they hadn't aged a bit since 1991 (R) Spot the difference! Elizabeth (L) didn't look a day older than she did while filming the show in 1991 (R) Better with age: Mario was looking leaner and perhaps even younger 25 years later . Back in the day: In a photo from 1992 the cast is seen posing together. (From left to right) Elizabeth Berkley, Mario Lopez, Tiffani Thiessen, Dustin Diamond, Lark Voorhies and Mark-Paul Gosselaar . Shortly after, Gosselaar receives a phone call from his beloved girlfriend, Kelly, played by Tiffani. As they wait for Kelly to arrive Jimmy confesses that he is moving to New York City. He says, 'I love it here but I want to be on Saturday Night Live. Host my own talk show, who knows, maybe one day, date Nicole Kidman'. The comedian pokes fun at himself following a recent awkward revelation on his show, in which Kidman said she had been interested in dating the star many years ago but thought he wasn't interested in return. The 'students' are then confronted by the school's principal Belding, played by Haskins. The principal: Haskins pictured during the reunion (L) and in 1989 (R) Reunited: Mario - who played A.C. Slater - and Mark-Paul Gosselaar - who played Zach Morris - were each dressed in their former character's favorite garb . Former TV flame: Mario also posed with co-star Elizabeth Berkley - also known as Jessie Spano - who he dated on the television programme . After he leaves Tiffani joins them in the hall way where she  announces she's pregnant, showing off a baby bump in her cheerleading uniform. The actress is currently expecting her second child, a boy, with husband Brady Smith. The couple already has a four-year-old daughter Harper. Diamond and his fiancee Amanda Schutz were arrested on December 25. He was charged with 'second-degree recklessly endangering safety, disorderly conduct and carrying a concealed weapon', according to People. Throwback: Mario Lopez shared the behind-the-scenes snaps to his nearly 400k Instagram followers . Back to school: Elizabeth cuddles up to Mark-Paul . Meanwhile, Diamond's onscreen love interest Voorhies (Lisa)  has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, according to her mother. Lark, now 38, has largely shied away from the spotlight following her tenure on Saved By The Bell, which wrapped in 1993, unlike her co-stars. Her mother told People Magazine in October: ‘There are things that have traumatised her. I care deeply about my daughter and I want her to resume her life.’ Also backstage: Mario then shared a picture with LA Lakers basketball star Kobe Bryant, who has been recovering from surgery on his shoulder . Special guests: Mario saved a snap of the Saved By The Bell signage from backstage of The Tonight Show . The 64-year-old shares a home with her daughter, who found fame aged 15, in Pasadena, California. But it seems Lark is not willing to face up to her condition. When asked by the magazine if she is suffering from any chronic condition including bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, she responded: ‘Oh no. We’re alive in a major time of all-in-all prophecy.’ The Jehovah’s Witness also said her long lapses of silence during conversations were merely moments in which she is praying, and added: ‘I have a strong spiritual sense.’"}

{"prompt": "(CNN)Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani has generated a firestorm by asserting, at a fundraiser for Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, \"I know this is a horrible thing to say, but I do not believe that the President loves America.\" Of course, that's nuts. Barack Obama's deep and true love for our country has been a hallmark of his career.  \"In no other country on Earth,\" he said when he was seeking the presidency, \"is my story even possible.\" Obama said this, it should be noted, in his masterly speech on race -- an issue that is America's most difficult and tortured. If you can proudly assert your love of country in a speech addressing the legacy of what he called, \"America's original sin\" -- slavery -- you really love this country. But it got me to thinking: How do you show love of country? Sure, you fly the flag in front of your house -- as Obama does.  Perhaps you wear a flag pin on your lapel -- as Obama does. But love of country demands more than mere flag-waving.  Let me suggest the top 10 ways all of us can show we love America: . 10. Support a strong central government. The Articles of Confederation were a disaster. The U.S. Constitution was designed by men who wanted a strong central government so as to build unity, strengthen the economy and defend the homeland. 9. Be skeptical of too much centralized governmental power.  Inconsistent? Well, that tension is at the heart of the American experience. George Washington and Alexander Hamilton wanted national strength; Thomas Jefferson and James Madison did not. To truly love America is to hold both ideas in your head at once. 8. Embrace immigrants. The best day I had in 2014 was the day my eighth-grader was chosen to speak to hundreds of new Americans at their naturalization ceremony. The energy, idealism and unadulterated patriotism in that room was overwhelming.  True love of country was in the air; and tears were in my eyes. 7. Connect with a soldier or a veteran. Slapping on a bumper sticker that says \"Support Our Troops\" is fine. But the truth is, less than 1% of all Americans serve in uniform, protecting the other 99% of us. We civilians are far too separated from our military.  I say this as one who never served, but whose father, stepfather and father-in-law all served in the Army; whose cousins have served, and who has friends on active duty today. As a professor at Georgetown I have taught many outstanding young officers over the past 14 years. I have kept in touch with many: some are still in uniform -- they give me firsthand reports of the glory and the errors of today's military.  Others are in civilian life: they connect me to the ground-level challenges young veterans face, from the job market to navigating the VA.  If you really love your country, the least you can do is be able to name someone who is sacrificing for your freedom. 6. Take off the rose-colored glasses. One reason Barack Obama's race speech was so remarkable is that he did not sugarcoat the evils of racism, nor has he allowed it to poison his view of the greatness of America. When you know the history of slavery, KKK terrorism and segregation, it helps you appreciate how far we have come. Real love, mature and deep, only comes from intimate knowledge.  Ignorant, blind adoration is best left to teeny-boppers at a Justin Bieber concert, not true patriots. The goal is not \"My Country, Right or Wrong,\" but rather \"Love Your Country: Right its Wrongs.\" 5. Travel around America. I have been in all 50 states. I had the privilege of visiting most of them with Bill Clinton. If you ever get the chance to fly a million miles with President Clinton, I highly recommend it.  Everywhere we went, we soaked up the local culture (and both of us inhaled the local cuisine). The lengthy, grueling presidential campaign gives our candidates a marrow-deep love for the wonderful diversity, the impossible breadth, and the miraculous unity of this country. 4. Then travel the world. The cliche is true: The more you see of the world, the more you love America.  Maybe one reason the Greatest Generation had such deep love for America is that they'd served their country overseas and seen the rest of the world at its worst.  At the same time, when you see other countries that are doing something better than we are; when you ride a highway in a Third World country that is smoother than your local interstate; when you see a successful European pre-K program, it makes you want to work to improve on those things at home. 3. Listen to someone you disagree with. Man, am I bad at this. But I try. I actually listen to Rush Limbaugh with some frequency. Sometimes I want to throw something at the dashboard, but other times I gain a perspective I lack. Besides, nothing is more American than a heartfelt political debate; and nothing is more boring than a vigorous agreement. 2. Inform yourself. Yes, the media is rife with faults, but we live in a time when technology empowers us to inform ourselves as never before. So, for example, before I jumped ugly over Sarah Palin's recent speech in Iowa, I got on my computer and actually watched the whole thing. Perhaps before they screamed about President Obama's speech at the National Prayer Breakfast, my conservative friends should have actually read it. If you truly love your country, get out of your media comfort zone (see #3 above), check out original sources, look up some history.  Arm yourself with facts if you want to really love your country. 1. Question your leaders in time of war. The greatest, most disastrous, most tragic governmental decision made in my lifetime was the Iraq War. Too many Americans, broken-hearted and justly vengeful after 9/11, meekly swallowed the Bush administration's line that Saddam Hussein was an imminent threat. Same thing with FDR's internment of Japanese-Americans in 1942. When your country is freaking out, when war fever is at its height, that is when questioning your leaders is the deepest display of patriotic love."}
{"prompt": "'Not acceptable': Theresa May fears relaxing visa rules for Chinese tourists could open the door to an influx of organised crime gangs . Theresa May has blocked plans to make it easier for Chinese tourists to get visas because she fears it would lead to a rise in organised crime, it has been revealed. The Home Secretary has warned that national security would be threatened and criminals would be brought in if checks on Chinese visitors were relaxed. A leaked letter from Mrs May's private secretary to the Prime Minister’s private secretary reveals her staunch opposition to the plans by Cabinet colleagues. According to the Daily Telegraph, the letter said: 'The proposal... is not acceptable to the Home Secretary for national security reasons. At Cabinet, the issue of asylum claims was discussed. 'We also face significant challenges with Foreign National Offenders and organised crime including drugs, money laundering, fraud, criminal finances, intellectual property, immigration and cyber crime.' Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt has raised concerns that potential tourists are being put off visiting the UK because of the expensive and difficult visa system. He is understood to be supported by the Chancellor, George Osborne, and Business Secretary, Vince Cable. But Mrs May has rejected the proposals to let Chinese tourists apply for European and British visas at the same time as she believes their checks ‘do not match the UK decision quality’. Economic boost: Official figures show that Chinese visitors typically spend an average of £1,700 per trip to the UK . She has also pointed to figures that show 400 Chinese criminals are awaiting deportation and there were 1,000 applications for asylum from Chinese citizens last year. Official figures show that Britain is losing out on the potential income generated by Chinese visitors, who typically spend £1,700 each per trip. Around 147,000 came to the UK last year compared to 1.2million who went to France. The Home Office said last night that improvements had been made to the Chinese service, including bringing in more visa officers and introducing an online application process, but declined to comment on the letter."}
{"prompt": "Prime Minister Tony Abbott has said the American-led invasion of Iraq left the country in chaos, in a rare criticism of Australia's strongest ally. Mr Abbott made the unusual remarks during a surprise visit to Baghdad. He has not ruled out sending more troops to the war-torn nation. 'Iraq is a country which has suffered a very great deal. First, decades of tyranny under Saddam Hussein. Then, the chaos and confusion that followed the American-led invasion. 'Most recently, the tumult, the dark age, which has descended upon Northern Iraq as a result of the Daesh death cult, but Australia will do what we can to help.' Wearing a leather jacket, Prime Minister Tony Abbott greeted diggers serving at the Baghdad Diplomatic Support Compound . Mr Abbott made a rare criticism of US foreign policy in Iraq, saying the aftermath of the invasion had left the country in 'chaos and confusion' On the third leg of an unannounced visit to the troubled region, Mr Abbott held talks with the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi in Dubai and visited an airbase. 'I certainly don't rule out doing what we reasonably can to make the world a safer place,' he said after the meeting. Australia is part of the US-led coalition carrying out air strikes against ISIL in Iraq and has deployed special forces troops to assist in training the local army. 'Because the ISIL or Daesh death cult has declared war on the world, including here and Australia.' Mr Abbott said he looked forward to further talks with Baghdad and coalition partners about what Australia 'can usefully do'. First visit to Iraq: Mr Abbott is pictured here with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi . The prime minister's latest comments and those he made after a meeting with Iraqi leader Haider Al-Abadi on Sunday have led to speculation Australia might be prepared to go beyond its limited commitment to the conflict. Back home, the Labor opposition is holding back bipartisan support for any expanded role. Instead it will wait for a detailed briefing from the government before revealing its position. Mr Abbott also rejected criticism of the secrecy surrounding his visit to Iraq and the United Arab Emirates. In a departure from previous practice, Australian media were excluded from covering the visit first-hand and were forced to rely on footage provided by the prime minister's office in Canberra. The opposition accused the government of pursuing a culture of secrecy, saying it was not in the national interest. But Mr Abbott said the media was excluded for 'understandable security reasons'."}
{"prompt": "By . Ruth Styles . PUBLISHED: . 06:07 EST, 1 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:48 EST, 1 April 2013 . She is remembered as a profligate shrew who drove her husband to drink before going insane, but according to a new book, that is not an accurate portrait of Zelda Fitzgerald. In fact, it's a 'persistent, damning mischaracterisation that needs undoing' says author, Therese Anne Fowler, who argues that not only was the spoiled wife of Great Gatsby author, F. Scott Fitzgerald sane, she was also devoted to her husband. Fowler, who began Z: A Novel of Zelda Fitzgerald wondering whether she really wanted to spend a year in the company of a 'hyperactive madwoman', says she soon discovered that almost everything she'd ever heard about the socialite was wrong. Outrageous: Both Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald achieved fame and fortune young but burned out quickly . Diagnosed with schizophrenia in her 30s, . Zelda spent her twilight years in a number of mental institutions, . eventually dying in a North Carolina asylum aged just 48. But was she really insane? Not so, . says Fowler, who argues that in the 1930s, 'schizophrenia' was a . catch-all term applied to a range of emotional difficulties. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, she adds: 'It was often applied to women who suffered from depression or exhaustion brought on by impossible circumstances. 'Zelda did suffer from some mental health crises - depression, primarily - and was an uninhibited, uncensored woman who didn't always think before she acted but she wasn't crazy. 'Unwise? Sometimes. Insane? No.' Fowler also goes on to rubbish the myth that The Great Gatsby's Daisy Buchanan is synonymous with Zelda, instead arguing that although there are some commonalities and F. Scott borrowed heavily from Zelda's diaries, the two were not the same. Tragic: Both Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald died young, although their daughter had a long, happy life . Fame: The Great Gatsby painted a decadent picture of 1920s New York and made F. Scott Fitzgerald's name . Born in 1900, Zelda was the youngest daughter of Alabama Supreme Court Justice, Anthony Sayre and his wife, Minnie Machen Sayre. She met her future husband at a dance in 1918 but was told not to get involved with him by her parents who thought the young F. Scott Fitzgerald entirely unsuitable. Defying her parents, Zelda continued to see F. Scott and the couple married just before her 20th birthday. The pair left to live in New York, the setting for many of Fitzgerald's most famous novels, and at the beginning of the Roaring Twenties, a glitteringly decadent place to be. The 1920s was the beginning of a social revolution, which saw women emerge from the home and join men in bars and nightclubs unchaperoned and unfettered by the mores of the Victorian era. Women smoking and drinking became a common sight, as did seeing them dance with abandon and engaging in casual relationships. Even skirts got shorter, with the austere full length skirts and high necked blouses of wartime giving way to sparkling, beaded flapper dresses. The older generation were scandalised but for Zelda and her new husband, it was just what the doctor ordered. Decadent: The glittering world of The Great Gatsby will be brought back to life in Baz Lurhman's 2013 film . Scandalous: The behaviour of young flappers such as these was viewed with horror by the older generation . They quickly became doyennes of the New York social scene but it wasn't enough for Fitzgerald, who didn't just want to be famous, but rich and brilliant as well. For her part, says Fowler, Zelda was desperate for him to succeed in every way. After their daughter, Scottie, was born in 1921, the pair moved to France, so Fitzgerald could concentrate on his writing. But although the pair enjoyed some success during this period, the Fitzgeralds' peripatetic lifestyle and passionate marriage began to take its toll. By this point, Zelda had begun her own literary career, penning a semi-autobiographical novel called Save Me the Waltz, which lifted the lid on her rocky marriage. F. Scott was furious, saying their life together was 'his material'. He was also drinking heavily, which led to increasingly violent rows. It was now, says Therese, that both their lives began to spiral inexorably out of control. Estranged through the later years of their marriage, F. Scott spent his twilight years in Hollywood attempting to forge a career in screen writing and pursuing an affair with movie columnist, Sheilah Graham. He died, aged 44, of a heart attack in 1940. He hadn't seen his wife, who outlived him by eight years, for more than 18 months. Z: A Novel of Zelda Fitzgerald by Therese Anne Fowler is published on the 11th April by Hodder & Stoughton."}

She had suffered more than 50 injuries to her head, body and limbs, including carpet burns and a bite mark on her shoulder. Muddar dialled 999 to say Ayesha was dead, and that Chowdhury had tried to kill herself and was in the bath. Paramedics discovered the body of the little girl 'cold and stiff' lying along the side of her bed dressed only in a pair of pants. The cause of her death was a head injury. On guard: Police at the scene of Chowdhury's flat in August 2013, where Muddar had been living with her . Prosecutor Richard Whittam QC said: 'At the core of this case is the relationship between Kiki Muddar and Polly Chowdhury. 'To say that their relationship was unconventional is a gross understatement. It was complex and involved fictional characters.' He said the pair had first struck up a close friendship when they lived near each other. In 2012, Muddar moved into Chowdhury's home, forcing her husband to sleep downstairs and leading to the eventual breakdown of the marriage. Mr Whittam said Chowdhury was turned against her own daughter by Muddar and her array of fictional characters. One was a so-called spiritual Muslim called Skyman who only communicated by text, and the mother tried to act in a way that would 'please him', the court heard. Chilling messages in capital letters by 'Skyman' - from Muddar's phone - were read to the court. One read: 'Your daughter was staring at your soulmate why was she not disciplined'. Others read 'Your daughter will pay', 'your daughter can have the pain', 'your daughter will destroyed', and 'your daughter is eveil [sic] you never disciplined her today'. Another read: 'You have no right to ever love or like your evil daughter'. The prosecutor also said Chowdhury had fallen in love with another of Muddar's fictional Facebook characters, a man named Jimmy Chowdhury. A sexual relationship developed between the women because Chowdhury thought she was having sex with her soulmate 'through the medium of Kiki'. But the prosecutor said: 'He is a fiction pieced together by Kiki Muddar. He existed only on Facebook, by text message or through Kiki Muddar herself. 'There was a photograph of a man she had placed on the Facebook page but that was not Jimmy Chowdhury. In a phone call to a friend a month before Ayesha died, Muddar described the girl as a 'witch' and threatened to drown her and go to prison, jurors were told. She allegedly said: 'I'm going to go to prison tonight' 'Polly Chowdhury never met him, nor did she speak to him, yet it appears Polly Chowdhury fell in love with this fictional Jimmy Chowdhury.' Mr Whittam said there was 'ample evidence' of Muddar's strength of feeling towards Chowdhury and her attitude towards Ayesha expressed through thousands of text messages, Facebook entries and telephone calls. In a phone call to a friend a month before Ayesha died, Muddar described the girl as a 'witch' and threatened to drown her and go to prison, jurors were told. She allegedly said: 'I'm going to f****** kill her. I will drown her in the f****** bath. I will drown that witch. I'm going to go to prison tonight.' Muddar also pretended to have cancer and blamed Chowdhury for making her condition worse, the court heard. Added to the 'complexity', Muddar also claimed to receive text messages from a former lover who she claimed had died in the London riots. Muddar, of Ilford, Essex, and Chowdhury, Chadwell Heath, Essex, deny murder, manslaughter and causing or allowing the death of a child between March 1 and August 29 2013. The trial continues.

Brazen:  Robber, wearing tracksuit trousers, sunglasses and a distinctive hooded jumper, strolls into the Natwest branch in Newcastle on Friday morning . Unidentified: Police are appealing for witnesses to the robbery which took place on Gosforth High Street in Newcastle on August 8 . He is seen speaking to two tellers - behind a protective window - for several seconds before being briefly interrupted by a witness behind him. Unperturbed, the hooded man turns back to face staff and continues his demands before being handed a wad of cash amounting to £2,480. After leaving the branch he stays at walking pace until turning a corner into Gosforth shopping centre - at which point he breaks into a run, escaping from the south entrance. No one was injured during the incident and police say they do not believe the man was armed. It has been suggested that the raider scared staff by claiming to have a concealed weapon.

{"prompt": "Rare outing: William and Kate at a friend's wedding at the Church of St Peter and St Paul in Northleach, Gloucestershire, in 2010 . Prince William is not a regular churchgoer despite being the future Defender of the Faith and Supreme Governor of the Church of England, the Daily Mail has learnt. Although the 30-year-old future king was confirmed into the Anglican faith in 1997, he is understood to attend services of worship only a ‘handful’ of times each year. Most of these are connected with official engagements or on special occasions in the Christian calendar such as Christmas, as well as weddings and christenings. Sources say William – and his wife Kate – ‘rarely, if ever’ go to church privately on a Sunday morning, or indeed at any other time in the week. A senior aide also admitted: ‘I’m not aware that he goes every week.’ While William is not alone in being a non-attender – barely 8 per cent of those who attend church regularly are young men his age – his stance is unlike other members of the Royal Family. The Queen is a devout Christian, with a deep sense of religious duty, who attends church on a weekly basis. Prince Charles, despite his interest in other faiths, particularly Islam, has always been a regular churchgoer. The revelation about William comes at a time when Christianity is already under threat from public apathy, particularly among the younger generation. Just 10 per cent of the population now attend church each week, while the average age of worshippers has risen to just under 60. According to one survey by Christian charity Tearfund, the UK is among Europe’s four least observant counties. Two thirds of those polled had not been to church in the past year, except for baptisms, weddings or funerals, although 53 per cent still identified themselves as Christian. 'Rarely, if ever': Sources say William and Kate (pictured on their wedding day in Westminster Abbey) only attends services of worship only a 'handful' of times each year . The monarchy, however, has a unique relationship with the Anglican Church. The sovereign holds the title ‘Defender of the Faith and Supreme Governor of the Church of England’. In his or her coronation oath they also promise to maintain the Church, a vow that the present Queen takes very seriously. Archbishops and bishops are appointed by the monarch on the advice of the Prime Minister, who in turn considers the names selected by a Church Commission. They take an oath of allegiance to the Queen on appointment, as do parish priests, and may not resign without royal authority. Every five years the Queen opens the General Synod, the supreme authority of the Church of England, and any ‘law’ passed by it has to be given royal assent. Not alone: William, pictured giving a religious reading during a diamond wedding anniversary of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh service, is not alone in being a non-attender - barely 8 per cent of those who attend church regularly are young men his age . While there is little doubt  that when he accedes to the throne William will uphold these responsibilities, his decision not to  worship regularly will add fuel to the fire of those who argue that  the church has little relevance in Britain today. The last known occasion William went to church was with his wife and her family in Berkshire on Christmas Day. Before that the couple attended a service in the Solomon Islands in September as part of a South Pacific Diamond Jubilee tour on behalf of the Queen. Religious royals: The Queen (right) is a devout Christian who attends church on a weekly basis and Prince Charles (left) has always been a regular churchgoer . A spokesman for the prince insisted yesterday that he was a dedicated Christian despite his lack of regular attendance. ‘The Duke of Cambridge is a committed Anglican and has a strong personal faith,’ they said. Aides also pointed out that not only was he confirmed in 1997 when he was 14, but he and his  wife wrote a prayer for their wedding service as evidence of his ‘continued faith’. Confirmation marks the point  in the Christian journey at  which believers affirm for themselves the faith into which they have been baptised. Weeks before their 2011 wedding, Kate also chose to be confirmed. The Archbishop of Canterbury’s office declined to comment last night, but a spokesman for the Church of England said: ‘In addition to obviously being sovereign, the requirement for a Supreme Governor is that they are “in communion” with the Church of England. According to the Book of Common Prayer this means taking communion three times a year.’ All aboard: The Queen yesterday .

The child was named Dushy after Van der Sloot's grandmother. Van der Sloot also remains the chief suspect in the 2005 disappearance of U.S. teenager Natalee Holloway in Aruba. Scroll down for video . Killer Joran Van der Sloot is a father after his wife gave birth to a baby girl on Sunday. In 2010, he confessed to killing Stephany Flores, a 21-year-old business student. The murderer was the last person seen with U.S. student Natalee Holloway, who vanished while on a  trip to Aruba. No charges were filed against Van der Sloot and the case remains unsolved . Van der Sloot married 24-year-old Leidy Figueroa (pictured last week) in July. She gave birth to his daughter on Sunday, whom she named Dushy after Van der Sloot's grandmother . Van der Sloot married 25-year-old Peruvian trainee accountant Leidy Figueroa in July. A month later, authorities sent him to a prison high in the Andes, saying he had threatened to kill the warden of the lockup near Lima. Van der Sloot  was transferred to the feared Challapalca prison just over a month ago. In interviews exclusively with MailOnline last week, Figueroa spoke for the first time to insist that Van der Sloot is 'gentle, sensitive, kind' and 'no monster', despite being a convicted murderer and the main suspect in the disappearance of American student Miss Holloway in 2005. Ms Figueroa insisted her husband has changed since they started an unlikely prison romance four years ago. She declared: 'My Joran is no monster'. Stephany Flores Ramirez, 21, (left) who was found murdered at the Miraflores Hotel Tac in Lima, Peru, in April 2010. Joran Van der Sloot, the 23-year-old Dutch playboy twice arrested in the mysterious disappearance of American teenager Natalee Holloway in 2005 (right), confessed to the murder . She said the 6ft 5in killer is a 'different man' after finding God and says he 'seeks forgiveness' for the evil he has committed. And in a series of astonishing prison love letters seen by MailOnline, Van der Sloot's passionate feelings for his 5ft 3in wife were laid bare. Ms Figueroa also said that her husband is close to breaking point after becoming deeply depressed by his new living conditions which he describes as 'worse than Guantanamo Bay'. The prison's conditions are in stark contrast to those under which Van der Sloot fell in love with Leidy in an unlikely prison romance four years ago. The couple were even allowed to marry behind bars earlier this summer. Lax prison rules also meant he was able to play online poker, use a cellphone, take drugs and have other women come and go as he pleased. And he enjoyed teaching English to other inmates and doing arts and crafts, making ceramic sculptures for his wife. Van der Sloot was transferred to Challapalca after he threatened to kill the warden of the Piedras Gordas penitentiary in Lima. He was found with an illegal cellphone which was confiscated, officials of the Inpe prisons administration said. Van der Sloot even recorded a video in which he showed the conditions in his cell, later saying that it was warden Sergio Haro who provided him with the cellphone. 'The warden himself gave it to me. I don't know why, but I suspect that it was to set a trap for me,' said Van der Sloot in a portion of the video. According to Leidy, Warden Haro was furious and told her husband he had never liked him. Van der Sloot was immediately thrown in the 'Hole' – solitary confinement – for six days.

Leidy said: 'When he came out of the Hole the warden told Joran that he won't see his baby daughter when she's born. Joran didn't believe him but the warden is true to his word.' However she is confident that one day she and Van der Sloot will be together properly. 'Somehow one day he’s going to leave prison and we can be a family,' she said. Van der Sloot is expected to remain in prison until 2038 and then be extradited to the United States to face charges of extortion and fraud for allegedly falsely promising to lead Natalee Holloway's mother to the girl's body in exchange for $25,000 payment. The murderer was the last person seen with Holloway, who vanished while on a high school graduation trip to Aruba. No charges were filed against Van der Sloot and the case remains unsolved.

The thief then pretended she needed to get some cash because her credit card was damaged - but unsurprisingly, she did not return.

{"prompt": "By . Jessica Satherley . UPDATED: . 09:49 EST, 13 December 2011 . A former military pilot has taken to New York City's streets in this Transformers costume he made himself out of household items. Peter Kokis, 49, has spent 675 hours meticulously creating 'Brooklyn Ironhide' - 164lb body suit replica of Transformers leader Optimus Prime. It is made from hundreds of random domestic items including spatulas, toothbrush holders, sewing machine parts, toilet brushes and even a pooper scooper. Transformer fan: Peter Kokis, 49, has spent 675 hours meticulously creating 'Brooklyn Ironhide' out of household items from his New York home . The Autobot fan now travels around his home city of New York attending corporate and public events and greeting stunned members of the public. Peter came up with the inventive idea in 2008 when he was invited to a sea-themed fancy dress party. He spent hours creating a cross between Optimus Prime and a squid using small household tools sold in convenience stores. 'Brooklyn Ironhide' is not an exact replica of the Transformers character Optimus Prime, but it is his own creation inspired by the Transformers characters . After getting pats on the back for his efforts, Peter decided to build a full exoskeleton based on Optimus Prime. Proud artist: Peter now attends private and corporate parties and promotional events as the Autobot . Inspired creation: Peter's Autobot (left) was inspired by Optimus Prime (right) from the Transformers series . He has now built four - including this original creation, the incredible Brooklyn Ironhide. The suit's items also include two hockey leg guards, six radiator knobs, a number of sewing machine parts and even two shoehorns. His shins are large pooper scoopers, there are a number of bird feeders over the body and each cannon has a toilet brush holder on it. He said: 'No single part of any of my exoskeletons is particularly expensive, but all those little parts add up, even though many come from cheap discount stores. 'Sometimes I see something - a paper towel holder, a soap dish, contact lens case, whatever - and I immediately know what I want to do with it. 'Other times I see something and am struck by its interesting shape, and I buy it for some future use, or the part doesn't work out so I throw it away.' It took the 49-year-old 600 hours over a 13 month period to create Brooklyn Ironhide - and even then he wasn't happy with the final results. Meeting his fans: Peter says 'little kids are in awe of the Transformer, sometimes hugging at the legs and screaming they love me' So he went back to the drawing board and spent a further 75 hours perfecting the armoured suit, which has cost 'thousands' of dollars in total. The artist and sculptor now attends private and corporate parties and promotional events as the Autobot through his company Brooklyn RobotWords - as well as meeting members of the public while suited up. He said: 'It is a very physically and emotionally exhausting endeavour. Performing in very heavy, unventilated suit of armour is quite challenging at 49, so I have to spend a lot of time in the gym. 'Little kids are in awe of the Transformer, sometimes hugging at the legs and screaming they love me. 'The little ones who have seen the films and comics often think I'm real - although I can't imagine what it must be like for a four-year-old old when Brooklyn Ironhide is standing over him. 'I was recently dressed as Ironhide and with a boy who was about four when his six-year-old older sister started throwing rocks at me to protect him. I thought that was cool. 'Dogs usually growl at me, though the other day I had a dog licking Bumblebee's face.'"}

Mihalik, a native of Turkey, was accused of sending $2,050 in three wire transfers to a person in Pakistan over a period of three weeks in late 2010 and early 2011, the statement said. Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the attorney's office, would not comment on the identity of the person in Pakistan. A telephone message left late Wednesday by CNN for Mihalik's attorney, Alan Eisner, was not immediately returned. Mihalik has been in U.S. custody since August 27, 2011, after she was detained at Los Angeles International Airport where she was preparing to board a flight to Turkey, the statement said. She had a one-way ticket, it said. Federal authorities say they first questioned Mihalik on August 8 at the airport where she had just arrived from a six-month trip to Turkey. At that time, they allege she lied to agents, saying she had never used an alias to send money via Western Union to a person overseas, authorities said. It was unclear how authorities linked Mihalik to the alleged payments, and they did not say how they identified her alleged use of an alias. Mihalik was initially indicted on August 30 on one count of making a false statement. A federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment Wednesday, charging Mihalik with three counts of providing material support to terrorists and one count of making a false statement. The charge of providing material support to terrorists carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison; the charge of making a false statement in a matter involving international terrorism carries a maximum penalty of eight years. An arraignment date has not yet been set. A trial on the initial count of making a false statement was previously scheduled for February 14."}
{"prompt": "By . Steph Cockroft . Even though Becky Tully loves her three boys with all her heart, she had always craved a baby girl who she could dress up, style and spoil like a real princess. So when doctors told Mrs Tully that she could not have any more children, the 38-year-old was devastated about giving up her dream. But the former care home worker soon found comfort - in five life-like plastic dolls. Becky Tully, 38, from south London, who has three sons, adopted five life-like dolls after she was told she could not have any more children. The babies - Emma, James, Max, Sophie and Connor - are treated as part of the family . Now their doting 'mother' has spent £17,000 buying the silicone models - known as reborn dolls - their own cots, dummies and stylish wardrobes to make them part of the family. Mrs Tully said: 'The boys thought it was a bit strange at first, but once they knew how happy their mummy was, they didn’t mind.' Mrs Tully, from south London, already had three sons  - Joshua, 20, Jack, 17, and Jacob, 11 - when she had to undergo a hysterectomy in 2009, after developing endometriosis and liver disease. The mother-of-three - who had to give up her job in a residential care home because of her illness - became so unwell that her husband Andrew, 40, became her full-time carer. As well as being house-bound for months on end, Mrs Tully was heartbroken that she would never have the chance to mother a young girl. But Mrs Tully's life was completely changed one year later, when she saw a documentary on TV about the reborn dolls. The silicone dummies are hand-picked by would-be mothers for . their realistic weight and soft feel, although they lack the sounds and . smells of a real baby. Just days later, Mrs Tully had ordered Sophie - who she even designed with matching brown hair, so she would look like part of the family. Mrs Tully, pictured here with one of her babies Max, has now spent £17,000 on clothes, accessories and prams to make the five children her own. She says she often scrimps and saves to ensure her babies - who have more than 500 outfits between them - never have to wear the same outfit twice . She said: 'I . spent £840 on Sophie with the care home wages I had left, but it was . worth it - I fell in love with her straight away. These babies are so . unique and precious. 'I ordered Sophie from an online reborn artist and paid for her over nine months in instalments. 'Waiting for her to arrive almost felt like a real pregnancy - it was so exciting. 'I wanted her to look like she could be a part of the family, and her dark brown hair matched mine exactly.' Sophie, pictured left, was the first doll to be adopted by Mrs Tully in 2010. She loved Sophie so much that she went on to adopt four more babies, including Emma, pictured right . Reborn doll Max is one of the five babies who is treated as children by Mrs Tully. The babies have their nappies changed, sleep in a cot in her room and are taken out on day trips with the family . Connor, pictured left, and James, pictued right, are showered with lavish gifts and never wear the same outfit twice . Sophie was the start of a new-found love for Mrs Tully. In the following year, Mrs Tully bought another four dolls - Emma, James, Max and Connor - who she started showering with lavish gifts. She changed their nappies, gave them dummies and put a cot in her bedroom for the babies to sleep in. She even spent more than £5,000 on clothes for the dolls, as well as £500 on shoes, ensuring they never had to wear the same outfit twice. Mrs Tully loves shopping for her the dolls' outfits at GAP, Next, George at ASDA and Mothercare and has spent £5,000 on clothes alone for the babies . The reborns have more than 500 outfits between them and Mrs Tully loves shopping . for the clothes at GAP, Next, George at ASDA and Mothercare. Dolls - £8,000 . Clothes - £5,000 . Shoes - £500 . Cots, cribs and prams - £1,000 . Baby accessories - £2,000 . Hair accessories and hats - £500 . Mrs Tully says she scrimps and saves to pay for new outfits for reborns, sacrificing treats for herself to spoil the children. She says: 'I’ve taken the babies to Bluewater Shopping Centre, and I’ll often treat them to a day out at our local wildlife park. 'Me . and Andrew take them out shopping together and, although he was . embarrassed at first, now he’s more than happy to take over Daddy-duty . and hold their pram. 'He knows how happy they make me and when my oldest son moves out, he’s going to help me turn the spare room into a nursery.' Mrs Tully’s reborns are so realistic that shop assistants often can’t believe she’s cradling a fake baby. Mrs Tully says the bill for the dolls' shoes comes to more than £500. She also spent £500 on hair accessories and hats, as well as £2,000 on what she described as 'baby accessories' She said: 'I love going to Claire’s Accessories to buy pretty hair slides and accessories to style the girls' hair. 'One day the shop assistant was cooing over Sophie, and couldn’t believe it when I revealed she wasn’t a real baby.' For Mrs Tully, her new 'children' have brought her the happiness she never thought she would feel. 'Sometimes . I will hear people talking about the dolls, questioning whether they’re . fake or not, but it doesn’t bother me, they make me happy. 'I love my boys so much, but I desperately wanted a little girl so I could style her hair and pick out pretty dresses' 'I was heartbroken when I had to give up work, and then to make matters worse, my dream of having another child was also in tatters. 'Andrew had to give up his job as a lorry driver to look after me. Now he’s my full-time carer. 'I love my boys so much, but I desperately wanted a little girl so I could style her hair and pick out pretty dresses.' Mrs Tully said the rest of her family have also learned to love the dolls. She said: 'Andrew doesn’t mind sharing our bedroom with the dolls, and I’ve even taught my youngest son how to care for them too. 'He knows how to hold their tiny heads properly, and will put them to bed for me. 'I’ve brought three prams, two moses baskets, a swinging crib and play gyms for the babies to use.' The reborn addict hopes to expand her brood and has recently ordered her most expensive baby yet, Evie Margaret, priced at £900. Mrs Tully said: 'I said I wouldn’t buy any more dolls, but I couldn’t resist Evie, she was too cute. 'Evie will have new outfits for special occasions, and just like the other babies, she won’t leave my side. 'I know I’ve spent a lot, but Andrew supports my spending because these babies have changed my life. 'Some people might think it’s strange, but it’s only the same as men being obsessed with cars - instead my obsession is reborn babies. 'My health condition does get me down and these babies have brought me so much happiness. 'Nothing can ever replace the love I have for my real kids, but I still love my vinyl brood, and I’ll keep making a special home for them.'"}
{"prompt": "A record 40 per cent of all spending on shoes by women was done online last month . Forget trudging up and down the high street to find that perfect pair of heels. It seems that growing numbers of women would rather avoid the hassle and buy their shoes online. A record 40 per cent of all spending on shoes by women was done online last month, research shows. It is the latest evidence of how the internet has revolutionised our spending habits. The data from the British Retail Consortium found that almost a fifth (18.4 per cent) of all shopping in January for everything except food was done through websites rather than in stores. This is a huge jump of 11.7 per cent from January last year. Online spending rates were particularly high for fashion. More than a quarter of money spent on clothing, or £1 in every £4, was done through websites – even though shoppers cannot try items on before they buy. The rate was even higher for shoes, at more than a third (£1 out of every £3) for the whole population and rising to two fifths (£4 in £10) for women. The BRC suggested that the high numbers of shoes bought online was because ‘the customer experience is generally a better one than in stores’. This could be because stores become overcrowded, particularly during the January sales, or because it can be a lottery as to whether that store has a particular style or size in stock. In contrast, shoppers can browse hundreds of designs on websites from the comfort of their homes and see in an instant whether their size is available. Scroll down for video . Helen Dickinson, BRC director general, said that internet spending in January tends to be high because of online bargains after Christmas, but this year ‘January online sales made up their largest proportion of overall retail sales, only second to November’. She added: ‘As websites continue to improve, including ease of use on mobile devices, with more stock being listed online, it is not a surprise that we loved buying online this January.’ David McCorquodale, head of retail at accountancy firm KPMG, said stores need to invest in their websites and improve the experience for customers. ‘Online sales had a strong January, bolstered by seasonal sales campaigns and targeted marketing drives,’ he said. ‘This side of retailers’ business has a leading role to play in driving overall sales growth, with more shoppers than ever choosing the convenience of buying online. ‘In order to significantly move the dial, substantial spend is needed to improve the robustness of retailers’ systems and improve the experience for customers. Retailers’ online operations warrant the lion’s share of their investment budgets this year.’ Recent research by communications watchdog Ofcom found that Britons spend more money online per head than any other developed country in the world. The figure is almost £2,000 a year – which is £600 more than the next-highest biggest spenders, Australians. Ofcom suggested this was thanks to widespread broadband access in the UK."}

The victims were struck down in two separate attacks, and police later arrested a 48-year-old Shanghai-born man who they said had dealings with both offices. The fatal attacks took place within 90 minutes of each other, at two separate lawyers' offices, and also saw two men injured. Killings: Police officers are seen at one of the lawyers' offices where a woman died after a man who allegedly had dealings with the lawyers attacked . The first attack took place at a lawyers' office in Düsseldorf, where a man stabbed a woman to death and injured a man, before reportedly also using a firearm and then set a fire, prosecutor Christoph Kumpa told reporters. The suspect had a dispute with a lawyer in the office, police later confirmed, but did not reveal the identity of the victim. About 90 minutes later, a lawyer's assistant was shot dead at an office in Erkrath, some nine miles away, and another man was injured. According to police, the arrested man's legal case had been referred to the Erkrath office. Security forces: Police officers guard a street near the Düsseldorf lawyer's office where the first woman was killed around midday . Captured: A Shanghai-born 48-year-old man was later arrested on suspicion of carrying out both killers, and he later confessed to the attacks . Under arrest: It is believed that the male suspect had dealings with both of the lawyers's offices . Police launched a massive manhunt and arrested the man Friday afternoon in Goch, near the Dutch border, after he forced his way into a pizza restaurant - setting off a scuffle in which two people were lightly injured. Kumpa said the suspect apparently had a score to settle with the restaurant's owner. Officials identified the suspect only as Yanquing T., in keeping with German privacy rules. They said the 48-year-old, who was born in Shanghai and lived in Düsseldorf, admitted the attacks."}

The financial crisis has been as devastating for family incomes as a world war, a senior Bank of England official warned yesterday. It is likely that the costs will still be being paid by our grandchildren, Andrew Haldane added. He said there was ‘every reason’ for people to feel ‘deeply upset and angry’ about the turmoil inflicted by the crash of 2008 and 2009. Andrew Haldane's (left) statements come as George Osborne is prepared to unveil another round of cuts . In a sober analysis of the scale of . the challenge facing Britain Mr Haldane, the Bank’s executive director . for financial stability, said: ‘If we are fortunate, the cost of the . crisis will be paid for by our children. More likely it will still be . being paid for by our grandchildren. ‘In terms of the loss of incomes and outputs, this is as bad as a world war – that’s the scale we’re talking about.’ George Osborne will tomorrow . acknowledge in his autumn statement that bringing the public finances . back to order will take significantly longer than the Government had . anticipated. The Chancellor is expected to accept . that debt as a proportion of GDP will not be falling by 2015-2016, one . of his key fiscal targets. To meet his main commitment, to . eliminate the structural deficit, he is expected to have to find more . than £23billion through further cuts and tax rises by 2017. Key out-of-work benefits are expected to be frozen and the best-off can expect to lose some of their pension tax breaks. 'Devastating': Andrew Haldane said people had 'every reason' to feel 'deeply upset and angry' about the turmoil inflicted by the crash of 2008 and 2009 . The Chancellor is expected to unveil a . series of measures to stimulate economic growth, including . infrastructure projects backed by £40billion of state guarantees, help . for smaller businesses that want to export, and a postponement of the 3p . a litre rise in fuel duty to put more money in people’s pockets. Mr Haldane, making his world war . comparison, told Radio 4’s the World at One: ‘It would be astonishing if . people weren’t fed up on the street, asking big questions about where . finance has gone wrong. There is every reason why the general public . ought to be deeply upset by what has happened and angry.’ In 2008 the then Chancellor, Alistair . Darling, came under fire from allies of Gordon Brown for saying that the . economic times Britain was facing were ‘arguably the worst they’ve been . in 60 years’ and would be ‘more profound and long-lasting than people . thought’. His warning has proved only too . accurate, according to Mr Haldane, based on the fall in the country’s . economic output since the recession and in the aftermath of the Second . World War. Output has fallen rapidly since the . recession, with real GDP currently 3.1 per cent below its 2008 peak. By . comparison, it rebounded fairly sharply after the end of the war. Mr Haldane said the banking industry . reached a pivotal moment in June when the scandal about the fixing of . Libor, a key interest rate, broke after a series of other events such as . the misselling of payment protection insurance. He said: ‘It was partly that the . public mistrust of the culture of banking had built up to such a point . that banking itself said: ‘‘Look, this has gone wrong’’.’ Mr Haldane said he would be . ‘surprised’ if the gold-plated salaries and bonuses enjoyed by City . executives – which have been a source of huge public anger – did not . fall further."}

Don’t think he will be getting the crowd to applaud on the first tee this week, will he? It was great last time, though. 'Unorthodox' Bubba Watson says he won't be goofy in Gleneagles . Jimmy Walker . Ryder Cup record: Debut. Don’t know a lot about him, to be honest. Played with him recently and he seems quiet and shy. Certainly hits it a long way. One of those swings where you wouldn’t think he’d be long, but he is. Plenty of short game, too. Zach Johnson . Ryder Cup record (W-L-H): 6-4-1 . I admire him a lot. Done it his way since day one. Shut at the top of his backswing and hits it with a big draw but look how much he’s won. And he’s like G-Mac in the Ryder Cup — never knows when he’s beaten. Phil Mickelson .

Hardly ever misses a fairway and while his putting stroke is pretty unique, it gets the job done. Jim Furyk . Ryder Cup record (W-L-H): 9-17-4 . It’s not going to be easy for him after last time, is it? There must be some scar tissue in there, but you have to say his play over the last six months has been fantastic. Relies on his wedge play and there’s plenty to rely on. A dejected Jim Furyk after his loss on the 18th in Medinah in 2012 . Patrick Reed . Ryder Cup record: Debut. I’ve barely spoken to him but he’s won three times so he’s obviously got a very decent game. Would he hold it against me if I said that claiming to be a world top five player is probably stretching it, though? Keegan Bradley . Ryder Cup record (W-L-H): 3-1-0 . You won’t be surprised to learn I love the fire he brings to the Ryder Cup. Okay, the caddie went over the top last time, swirling the flag above his head, but Keegan gets it and that’s great to see.

Shoppers can then use a simple wave of their hand to choose which ones they wish to 'try on', and instantly see what it looks like. The system - available in High Street shops this summer - is so advanced it can show how clothes hang from the shoulders and cling to the body. The device, hailed as 'every woman's dream invention', uses Microsoft's motion sensing technology, Kinect 3D. The technology brings to life the 1995 film Clueless, in which Alicia Silverstone's character Cher used a computer to help her decide what to wear.

{"prompt": "Hong Kong (CNN) -- Chinese police intercepted more than 3,600 crocodiles last week that were destined for dinner plates in the country's Guangdong province. The Siamese crocodiles were seized Tuesday in the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region after they crossed over the China-Vietnam border, according to reports in the Chinese state-run Xinhua news agency. Officials believe they were headed for restaurants in southern China -- known for its exotic dining options. Several of the crocodiles died from heatstroke during transportation, officials said, while the others are being treated by veterinarians. The Siamese crocodile, which can grow as long as 13 feet (3.96 meters) is one of the world's most endangered reptiles, according to the World Wildlife Fund. Hunting and habitat disruption has led the species to near extinction in the wild but they are extensively farmed in Thailand and Cambodia. Zheng Yuanying of the Green Eye of China environmental protection group told Britain's The Guardian that a strong black market has persisted in the region despite government efforts to crack down on exotic animal smuggling. \"Although people all know it is illegal to eat these wild creatures, they will still eat them as long as the market sells them. What's needed is a long-term, stronger campaign to explain to people why they shouldn't eat crocodile,\" he said. Earlier this month, China met with other Asian countries to enhance collaboration between countries to combat illegal wildlife trafficking, according to a report by TRAFFIC, a wildlife trade monitoring network. The provinces of Yunnan, Guangxi and Guangdong in southern China accounted for 68.3% of the national trafficking total in 2011, according to the report."}

However, it may be a different story for the late singer’s love child – who has been cut out of his inheritance altogether, the Daily Mail can reveal. The former Bee Gee died in May last year aged 62 after a long battle with colon and liver cancer. He was survived by his second wife Dwina, 60, their son Robin-John, 30, and his two children from his first marriage, Spencer, 41, and Melissa, 39. Assets: Robin Gibb's wife Dwina (pictured left with her late husband) will inherit his fortune while the daughter he had with his housekeeper Claire Yang (pictured right holding Snow Robin) has been cut out of his will . Gibb also left four-year-old daughter Snow Robin, who he fathered with his live-in housekeeper Claire Yang, then 33, in 2008. But newly released details of Gibb’s will show the youngster will not inherit any of his estate. The revelation follows reports of a feud between Mrs Gibb and Miss Yang. Although the singer and his partner of 35 years had an open marriage, Mrs Gibb reportedly stopped Snow and her mother from attending his funeral last year. Valued at £25.8million after tax, Gibb’s fortune includes all of his UK assets but does not include his properties in America or assets already shared jointly with his wife. The money has been placed in a trust fund, with Mrs Gibb receiving all profits until her death. The self-described Celtic druidess has also been granted all of her husband’s ‘personal chattels’ and the lucrative music rights to his share of the royalties from the Bee Gees’ back catalogue, which includes hits such as Stayin’ Alive and How Deep Is Your Love. Spencer and Melissa will each be given £500,000 immediately, with the remainder of the estate to be split between them and Robin-John upon Mrs Gibb’s death. Mourners: Although Gibb and his partner of 35 years widow Dwina (right) had an open marriage, Mrs Gibb reportedly stopped Snow and her mother from attending his funeral last year . Happy families: Gibb's wideo Dwina (centre) stands to inherit his fortune of £25.8million. The money is in a trust fund, with Mrs Gibb receiving all profits until her death, when their son Robin-John (left) will inherit . Miss Yang has been allowed to keep the £850,000 house Gibb bought her in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, but her daughter did not inherit anything from the will. The 15-page document was drawn up in August 2011, nine months before Gibb’s death, and was witnessed by his personal assistant and his chauffeur. In the final paragraph, Gibb stated that he was ‘in the process of making reasonable financial provision for Snow’. He asked his trustees to provide for her should he fail to do so before he died, but made no specific provision in his will. There were unconfirmed reports Gibb gave Miss Yang £5million before he died. But she refused to comment on the will or financial arrangements when she was approached at her home yesterday. News of Gibb’s affair with Miss Yang emerged only in February 2009 – three months after Snow was born at the private Portland Hospital in West London. It reportedly took a year for Gibb’s lawyers to agree a financial settlement with her for Snow’s future education and maintenance. The pair are thought to have been involved romantically for some years before the child’s birth. Miss Yang started out as the couple’s housekeeper, working at their 12th century mansion in Thame, Oxfordshire, and at their £2.6million waterfront beach house in Miami, Florida. Pay out: Gibb's children Spencer (left) and Melissa (right) from his first marriage to Molly Hullis (centre) have been given £500,000, with the remainder of the estate to be split between them and half-brother Robin-John on his mother's death . Smash hits: Mrs Gibb (pictured left) will inherit the lucrative music rights to Gibb's back catalogue of hits with the Bee Gees (pictured right). It is rumoured he gave his former lover Calire Yang £5million before he died . Following Snow’s birth, Gibb said: ‘New life is heaven sent and a blessing. That’s what I can say about children and life.’ Despite the affair, Mrs Gibb insisted she and her husband had a happy relationship. Earlier this year, she said: ‘It’s very important that people who are creative are given the freedom to create in a marriage. It’s not good to have jealousies around. ‘Some people even get jealous  of someone reading a book and not paying attention to them.  We were both creative and there was a lot of trust.’ She added: ‘Let’s just say Robin made sure everyone in his life was taken care of. They’ve been sufficiently provided for – everyone has.’ Gibb’s total fortune was estimated at £93million last year, significantly more than the amount bequeathed in his will. It is believed most of the remainder is tied up in assets held overseas as well as those owned jointly with his wife. Money held in joint bank accounts and all jointly owned homes pass directly to Mrs Gibb without being included in the will. It is not known whether Miss Yang plans to contest the will. Under the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975, any child is allowed to contest a will – or have it contested on their behalf – if they are excluded or if it is unfair."}

Lady Rendlesham's grandson was found hanged in his family's London town house after reading Brave New World. Clare Rendlesham, pictured, was a former Vogue editor . The grandson of former Vogue editor Clare Rendlesham was found hanged after reading Aldous Huxley's Brave New World novel. Maximillian Bromage’s body was discovered in August after spending the weekend alone in his family’s London town house. The 19-year-old, described as a ‘deep . thinker’, died just a week after enjoying a weekend with his parents at . their home in Wales, an inquest heard today. His father, Charles Bromage, told . Westminster Coroner’s Court a copy of Aldous Huxley novel Brave New . World was found in Maximillian’s bedroom after his death. He said: ‘He had obviously been reading it that evening, and unfortunately it has a similar ending.' In the novel, John, dubbed 'the Savage' is found hanged in his lighthouse retreat. Maximillian’s grandmother, fashion pioneer Lady . Rendlesham, made her name working for Vogue during the Swinging . Sixties, and went on to open the first Yves Saint Laurent store in the . UK, in Bond Street. Her . daughter Jaqumine, Maximillian’s mother, followed in her footsteps, . working as a director for Yves Saint Laurent until 1999 before setting . up business with her husband. Mrs Bromage said this morning they . had hoped Maximillian, who had shown a flair for fashion and design, . would follow them into the family business. She said: ‘You always hope if you have a business your child goes into it, and the opportunity was there if he wished.' The family saw no signs Maximillian was unhappy, and they have been ‘deeply affected’ by his death. She added: 'We had absolutely no inclination whatsoever. ‘At the weekend, he was on very good form, helping me cook and running with my husband. ‘Looking back at things, we had absolutely no idea.’ Maximillian had been reading Brave New World just before he was found hanged. The main character is found hanging at the end . Maximillian, a student at Aberwysth, had visited the family home in Presteigne, Powys, the weekend before he died. A sports enthusiast, he enjoyed running, climbing, hunting, and kickboxing, and had been skiing since the age of three. ‘He was completely flawless and was prepared to stand his ground for whatever he felt was right’, said coroners officer Lynda Morris reading a family background statement. ‘He had every opportunity in life he could ever have wished for.’ Maximillian was due to do work experience with the family firm, Indigo Investment Services Ltd when he died, on August 6 this year. He had travelled back to London from Wales a few days earlier, and was due to go to a concert with his girlfriend Cammie the day after he was found dead. His father said the couple had a ‘volatile’ relationship, and Maximillian had spoken to her for 20 minutes just after midnight the night he died. ‘I asked her if she was going out with Max and she said yes’, Mr Bromage said of the call he made to Cammie shortly after learning of his son’s death. ‘I think if she had thought otherwise, she wouldn’t have made that statement. ‘She has been deeply upset by it.’ Maximillian had been staying his paternal grandparent’s London home in Knightsbridge, when he died. Decorator Nigel Hall, a family friend for 15 years, entered the home at 9.30am to collect some tools and found Maximillian’s lifeless body on the first floor. PC Cherelle Roberts, the first officer on the scene, said there was no suicide note, and his laptop and mobile phone did not have any significant clues. She added of two note books found in his bedroom: ‘The large note book contained many love letters between Maximillian and his girlfriend Cammie. ‘The small note book was more of a diary of Maximillian’s feelings over the last six months or so before his death.’ Fashion pioneer Lady Rendlesham, pictured, went on to open the first Yves Saint Laurent store in the UK, in Bond Street. Her daughter Jaqumine, Maximillian¿s mother, followed in her footsteps . ‘But there was nothing dated from that day or indications of how his mind-set was leading up to it.’ The inquest heard Maximillian grew up in Notting Hill Gate, west London, before the family moved to Wiltshire when he was eight-years-old. He was educated at Summerfield School in Oxfordshire and then chose to go to Shrewsbury School instead of Eton College. He was tutored for his A Levels at Oxbridge, getting the grades to go to university to study International Relations and Strategic Studies, but was hoping to retake his A Levels to get better grades when he died. He had spent months in Nepal teaching English to children in late 2011 before returning to the UK. Assistant Deputy Coroner Darren Stewart returned an open verdict, after ruling he could not be sure Maximillian had meant to kill himself. ‘He had a volatile relationship with his girlfriend, he was making plans into the future, and this was reflected in the mood swings he documented himself in the notebook’, he said. ‘All this suggests this is a case where other explanations are possible that might explain his actions on the day in question.’ The post mortem ruled Maximillian Bromage, of Powys, died of hanging."}

A bride-to-be was forced to abandon her wedding plans after a drink-driver crashed into her car and left her with a six-inch scar on her forehead. Annabelle Cooper 26, said her confidence has been shattered following the crash which left her 'looking like a Chucky doll'. The mother, from Fawley, Hampshire, has called off her wedding to childhood sweetheart Michael Clarke, 26, because of the facial wound. She has suffered depression following the head-on accident with Jennifer Kemish's vehicle but is now trying to rebuild her confidence so she can walk down the aisle. The wedding was booked for April 6 to mark 10 years after she got together with her boyfriend Michael at school. However, her plans were shattered following the crash on February 15 this year. She had been due to get married at Southampton Registry Office with the reception at the nearby Royal British Legion. Kemish, 30, had drunk three pints of lager at a pub in Fawley before getting behind the wheel of her Ford Mondeo, a court heard. She lost control of her vehicle and drove on to a grass verge before swerving into the path of a Vauxhall Vectra driven by Mr Clarke. He was driving Miss Cooper and their three-year-old son Paul home from McDonald's along the A326, near Hardley, at the time of the crash. Damage: The wrecked car following the accident in Fawley, Hampshire, earlier this year . Scar: The wound has now healed but Miss Cooper has been left with a scar on her forehead . Miss Cooper had adjusted her seatbelt . to turn round to tend to Paul, when the impact threw her forward, . smashing her head on the windscreen. It knocked her unconscious, left Mr Clarke with whiplash and Paul with severe bruising. Prosecutor . Kelly Wickens told Southampton Magistrates' Court Kemish had 107mg of . alcohol per 100ml of blood, which is just over the legal limit of 80mg. She was banned from driving for 20 months, given eight penalty points and fined £600 after pleading guilty to driving without due care and attention while under the influence. Kemish, from Marchwood, Hampshire, was also given a community order, and told to pay £60 into a fund for victims of crime. Miss Cooper, from Fawley, said the pain and trauma of the accident will haunt her for the rest of her life. She blinked back tears as she said: 'I'm still so shocked that someone can get into a car and cause this amount of pain to someone. 'The judge thought the sentence was good enough for her and who am I to argue with that. But my wedding plans are shattered and I have got to live with it for the rest of my life.' Miss Cooper, who has no recollection of the impact but remembers waking up in hospital, said: 'I was really scared. Family: Annabelle, 26, with her partner of ten years Michael Clarke and their three-year-old son Paul . Devastated: Annabelle Cooper, 26 has had her confidence shattered following the accident . 'I didn't know what was going on and I . couldn't see anything out of my right eye. It was really shocking to . see my reflection in the bathroom mirror, I looked like a Chucky doll . and I just cried and cried. 'As . a girl I care a lot about my appearance. It's so upsetting and unfair . that we can't fulfill that special date, but after the crash it was the . last thing on our mind. 'It's been so much for us to go through so we are putting it off for at least a year or two. 'The scar has really hit my confidence, I don't go out and socialise as much - it feels like everybody's looking at me I need to build my confidence up. 'But we will love each other and will get married eventually no matter what.' Miss Cooper also suffers agonising headaches and abdominal pains and was forced to have her appendix removed. Paul is so traumatised he struggles to sleep at night. She added: 'I can never forgive her because my son was in the car and we were innocent people. There's no excuse to get in a car drunk, especially when you could get a taxi home. If it was me I would never get in a car again.' John Paul Jones, defending, said Kemish's partner suffered broken ribs in the accident and had to take three-and-a-half weeks off work to recover. Kemish admitted one charge of driving without due care and attention while under the influence, on February 15 this year. As she left court, she said: 'I am sorry for hurting them. I didn't mean for it to happen.' Magistrate Sue Williams described the crash as 'dreadful' and 'most upsetting'."}

Officials found the bodies of an elderly man and woman at a destroyed home that was a victim of the still-raging Colorado wildfire that was thought to have started from a protective burn. The couple, who are the only known victims of the blaze so far, were identified as Sam Lamar Lucas, 77, and Linda M. Lucas, 76. A cause of death was pending for both. A third person is missing in the fire zone, authorities said. Jefferson County Sheriff's spokeswoman Jacki Kelley said authorities do not know how many houses were lost but said it was at least five and probably more than 10. Earlier on Tuesday, authorities ordered residents of more than 900 homes to evacuate. Warning: Residents of another 6,500 houses were warned to be ready to leave because of the fire's erratic behavior. Many homes are in winding canyons, and authorities wanted to give citizens advance warning . Precautions: Over 100 firefighters were called in from neighboring states, but officials still don't want to completely put out the fire as it will help prevent future blazes . Residents of another 6,500 houses were warned to be ready to leave because of the fire's erratic behavior. Many homes are in winding canyons, and authorities wanted to give citizens as much advance warning as possible. 'We're in a defensive mode, structure protection only,' Ms Kelley said. 'We're not really fighting the fire right now.' Evacuees formed a long line to see a . list of damaged properties posted by the Red Cross at Conifer High . School.

The largest fire was burning about 25 . miles southwest of Denver in a rugged, largely rural area where the . altitude ranges from 7,000 to 8,200 feet. The region of pines and . grassland is dotted with hamlets and the occasional expensive home. It . is several miles - and mountain ridges - west of Denver's tightly . populated southwestern suburbs, which weren't threatened. The fire apparently flared up from a . prescribed burn conducted in the area last week, Kelley said.

Destructive: A large plume of smoke rises in the in southern foothills of Denver near Roxborough and Conifer, Colorado, as a wildfire erupted amid dry, windy weather . The fire threat in much of Colorado has grown during an unusually dry and warm March. On March 18, a grass fire charred 37 square miles in eastern Colorado and injured three firefighters. Across the West, most states face normal wildfire danger, according to the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho. However, the potential for summer . fires is significantly 'above normal' for New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, . Nevada and California, said center meteorologist Ed Delgado, . 'It's just a changing weather pattern. We're exiting La Nina, and becoming more neutral in that pattern,' Mr Delgado said. 'Historically when we've entered this . weather pattern, we've had situations that would be conducive to those . areas having a higher fire threat.' La Nina is a cooling of the surface water in the Pacific Ocean that causes disruptions to weather patterns. Billows of smoke were visible from . downtown Denver. Weather radar showed the smoke plume had drifted about . 100 miles to the northeast by nightfall, and state health officials . warned smoke could linger and affect air quality until Tuesday . afternoon.

{"prompt": "John Redwood, who produced the figures, says cutting the rate further would produce another surge in revenue helping to ease the deficit . The amount of tax paid by the best-off has soared since George Osborne slashed the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p, according to a new analysis. New figures from HM Revenue & Customs show the total income tax collected on earnings over £150,000 has shot up from £40 billion last year to £49 billion this year. Former Conservative Cabinet minister John Redwood, who produced the figures, said it appeared the Chancellor’s tax cut was having dramatic results in what would be a ‘shock to many of the conventional pundits’ who criticised the measure. He said the boost in income tax take suggested the Chancellor should go further, and make the 45p rate ‘more competitive’. ‘Total income tax collected from people earning more than £150,000 has surged from £40bn to £49bn this year compared to last. 'It has more than made up for the loss of tax revenue from lower earners following the big increase in tax thresholds,’ Mr Redwood said. He said the 50p rate introduced by Labour in its final weeks in power was clearly ‘costly’. Britain lost high earners overseas, and saw the richest use tax loopholes to declare less income when the rate was high. ‘The rareified group of people earning more than £2m declared income of £12.2bn in 2012-13, but paid tax on £26bn of income the following year with the lower rate. ‘This small group of people alone more than paid for the rise in threshold to take many lower earners out of tax altogether. ‘The top one per cent of earners now earn 13 per cent of the income but pay 28 per cent of the total income tax. The top five per cent earn one quarter of the income but pay around half the total income tax. ‘This progressive structure works as long as the government does not get too greedy, setting a higher rate which means the rich pay less because they either go or they earn and declare less. ‘I wonder how much more revenue the Treasury would enjoy if the top rate were set at a more competitive rate? 'I suspect that too would see a further surge in revenue, money the state clearly needs to end the deficit.’ George Osborne cut the 50p top rate of tax to 45p in his 2012 budget, saying it raised 'next to nothing' A Tory spokesman said: ‘The Government is clear that in clearing up Labour’s economic mess those with broadest shoulders should bear the biggest burden.’ David Cameron will today hail the Government’s tax changes taking effect this week as the most radical for two decades. On Tuesday, corporation tax came down to 21 per cent, the tax-free annual investment allowance for businesses was doubled, business rates were capped at two per cent and fuel duty was frozen. From Sunday, over one million businesses will benefit from up to £2,000 ‘cashback’ on their National Insurance contributions. The Prime Minister is to visit three businesses who are announcing a combined total of nearly 10,000 new jobs, including Accenture, which is taking on 500 new employees; Birmingham Airport, which is extending its runway leading to 4,000 jobs in the airport and an additional 4,000 jobs in the supply chain; and Vodafone is taking on an extra 1,400 staff. Mr Cameron said: ‘A key part of our long-term economic plan is to create jobs and to cut taxes. So I am delighted that in the week where we are cutting tax for 26 million hard-working people – and now taking three million out of tax altogether – I can announce nearly 10,000 more jobs which will give people financial security for the future.’ The personal income tax allowance will be raised this weekend from £9,440 to £10,000, cutting tax for the typical basic rate taxpayer by £705 this year."}

Attorney James Weinberger told CNN the ruling \"should serve as a deterrent to Mr. Yung or anyone else who thinks they can register names that include Trump's trademark and name and use them for commercial purposes.\" Trump is a trademark with the United States Patent and Trademark Organization and the name is associated with high-profile business ventures. The four websites were developed in 2007, the same year the Trump organization announced plans to build Trump-branded hotels and condominiums in Mumbai and Bangalore, India. The Trump Organization demanded that Yung hand over the websites. In 2011, Yung filed a complaint seeking to keep the domain names, citing fair use and First Amendment rights.

{"prompt": "Los Angeles (CNN) -- Chris Brown was booted from a rehab facility this month after smashing his mother's car window during a family session, his probation officer reported Wednesday. The judge overseeing Brown's probation in his Rihanna beating case ordered the singer to immediately enter another rehab program and stay for 90 days. Brown, who was arrested on an assault charge in Washington, D.C., last month, still faces a possibly probation violation charge that could send him to prison. \"There is much concern with the probationer's new arrest and his violent outburst that resulted in his discharge from a treatment facility,\" the probation report said. The singer sat nervously in a Los Angeles County courtroom, holding girlfriend Karrueche Tran's hand as he waited while his lawyer, Mark Geragos, met privately with the judge and prosecutor before his hearing began Wednesday afternoon. Brown's freedom has been in question since he was arrested on a sidewalk near the White House after allegedly punching a man. The probation imposed when he pleaded guilty to a felony charge in the 2009 attack on Rihanna -- his girlfriend at the time -- requires that he stay out of legal trouble. The lawyers and judge emerged from chambers with a deal, which required Brown to spend the next 90 days in a court-approved treatment facility. Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Mary Murray told the judge she still reserved the right to ask for Brown's probation to be revoked on the D.C. arrest. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge James Brandlin ordered the probation officer to provide a detailed report about that incident, with that report expected to be presented when Brown returns to court on December 16. Brown voluntarily entered a rehab center on October 28, a day after he was released from a Washington jail. \"His goal is to gain focus and insight into his past and recent behavior, enabling him to continue the pursuit of his life and his career from a healthier vantage point,\" representative Nicole Perna said when he entered. When he checked out on November 10 his representative said he would continue in the program as an outpatient. However, the probation report given to the judge Wednesday disputed that, saying he was kicked out of the program. It quoted a center official saying he was ordered out for \"breaking programs rules by acting violently.\" The violence involved Brown \"throwing a rock through his mother's car window\" after a family session at the center in which she said she wanted him to stay in the treatment. \"Mr. Brown preceded to walk outside and pick up a rock and threw it through his mother's car window and it shattered,\" according to letter from the rehab center included in the probation report. Brown's \"prognosis is very guarded\" unless he gets professional help, the letter said, . Brown will leave the new rehab center three days a week to work eight-hour shifts of community labor so that he can complete the 1,000 hours of work still remaining in his punishment for the attack on Rihanna. The report estimated he will have to work on community labor three days of every week until next August to meet his deadline. He may also travel to Washington for a court hearing Monday in the assault case there, the judge said. His lawyer said he would try to get the hearing delayed.

So stars such as Nicole Kidman (45), Julia Roberts (45), Catherine Zeta-Jones (43), Selma Blair (40) and Geri Halliwell (40) will be feeling more vibrant and youthful now than they were in their early and mid-thirties. Actresses Nicole Kidman, left, and Julia Roberts, right, are both 45 years old . More than half of women over 40 (55 per . cent) also say they are more confident in their appearance than when . they were in their thirties. And a 86 per cent insist 40 is now the new . 30. With many saying they feel rejuvenated, 17 per cent put this down to having a better sex life than ever before, while 27 per cent say their dress sense is better than ever. Today's women in their forties are happier in a wider range of clothes than ever. The research by health food company Linwoods . Superfoods  found nearly two thirds - 59 per cent - still feel confident enough to wear a bikini. And 60 per cent insist their generation should still feel happy wearing figure-hugging tops or showing a glimpse of cleavage. The study by health food company quizzed 2,000 women aged 40 to 65 about their lives to . discover the effect of passing the milestone. It seems many insecurities are banished as women hit their forties, with an overwhelming 81 per cent saying they are happier in themselves than younger women. Actresses Selma Blair, left, 40, and Catherine Zeta-Jones, right, 43, should now feel more confident, secure and happy with themselves than they did a decade ago . This may be due to almost a third, 32 per cent, being more financially secure than ever, while 48 per cent said they were in a stable relationship. Actress Samantha Womack, 40, who played Ronnie Mitchell in Eastenders, said: 'The days when your 40th birthday represented the start of a slow descent into a quiet middle-age are long gone. 'Not only are women of 40 still full of energy, they are enjoying lives full of promise and possibilities. 'Women who are 40 and older are not slowing down, with many having babies, caring for children, supporting their own parents and working hard to maintain careers.' At 40 years old both Geri Halliwell, left, and ex-EastEnder Samantha Womack, right, should be feeling more like 30-year-old spring chickens . Joanne Hayden from Linwoods Superfoods said: 'These survey results reinforce that age really is just a number. 'Women of 40 and over are as full of life as ever and feeling fabulous has much more to do with how satisfied you are in life, from organised finances to a healthy diet, small changes can make a huge difference.' Caroline Harvey, 44, a teacher from Winchester, Hants, said: 'I definitely feel better about myself and my life since turning 40. 'I was more confident in my thirties than in my twenties and more comfortable in myself again now I'm in my forties. 'I feel like a stronger person and I care much less what others think. I'm more confident in my work, my relationship and motherhood.'"}
{"prompt": "Efforts to clean up a 168,000 gallons of thick, viscous oil that spilled into the Port of Houston near Galveston, Texas, stretched into a third day Tuesday, as wildlife rescuers sought to estimate the impact on birds and marine life. The spill, which occurred over the weekend after two vessels collided, has forced the closure of the heavily trafficked port, putting dozens of ships in limbo as they wait in a queue to enter and exit the waterway early Tuesday afternoon. The Houston Ship Channel was opened to limited barge traffic within the channel, U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Andy Kendrick said, but the channel remained closed to all other vessels, and the vessels in the port were not allowed to leave. As of early Tuesday afternoon, 101 inbound and outbound vessels were stuck in the channel, Kendrick said. On Galveston Island, the cruise terminal is loaded with passengers waiting for ships docked at sea, while cruise ships waiting to get to port are stuck on the water. The U.S. Coast Guard and other agencies are evaluating whether portions of the busy shipping channel can be reopened, pending the \"skimming and booming\" efforts under way to contain the environmental disaster. Meanwhile, the Galveston Bolivar ferry has been granted permission to run amid efforts to clean the port and locate affected wildlife. According to authorities leading the joint effort to contain the spill, there have been 18 birds captured, 10 deceased, and eight \"oiled\" but not captured. There have also been sightings of oiled birds that have yet to be confirmed. Texas Parks and Wildlife Department personnel said they are continuing to look for affected wildlife in Bolivar Flats, which is considered a significant refuge for birds. \"Galveston Bay is one of America's greatest estuaries and an important home to Texas seafood providers and recreational fishermen as well as the entry point to the Port of Houston. While the area has long dealt with many pollution concerns, this spill is significant,\" said scientist Doug Rader of the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund. \"In the early stages of this spill much remains unknown, but for shrimp, blue crab, menhaden and other marine life, which rely on the bay as an essential nursery, further investigation and long-term monitoring within the footprint of this spill is necessary.\" Approximately 15.5 miles of nonconsecutive shoreline have been impacted, and more than 750 people are working to resolve the spill, officials said. The Coast Guard said they will continue their investigation. After 25 years, Exxon Valdez oil spill hasn't ended . Gulf oil may be big trouble for big fish . More on oil spills ."}

The couple, who left behind three adult children and two grandkids, had called Toowoomba home for 30 years. Friends and family of Roger and Jill Guard packed out a theatre in Toowoomba, west of Brisbane, on Sunday to pay their respects . Roger had spent 25 years as the director of pathology at Toowoomba Base Hospital, providing evidence for many coronial inquests, while his wife of almost 42 years, Jill, was a GP. The Guards had run the Queensland city's Road Runners and helped Sudanese women adjust to new life in Australia. The farmer's son and Congregational minister's daughter were among 298 people, including up to 39 Australian citizens, who died when Malaysia Airlines flight 17 was shot down over the Ukraine more than a fortnight ago. The couple's son Paul told the memorial service he and his siblings were glad their parents were together on their final adventure . The Guards' three adult children Paul, a coastal engineer, Amanda, a physiotherapist, and David, a pathologist like his dad, spoke of their love for their talented parents who explored the world with them . More than 1,000 people packed into Toowoomba's Empire Theatre on Sunday afternoon to remember the couple through song, music and poetry. The Guards' three adult children Paul, a coastal engineer, Amanda, a physiotherapist, and David, a pathologist like his dad, spoke of their love for their talented parents who explored the world with them. 'We're glad that you are together on your final adventure doing something you love,' eldest son Paul said. Jill's sister Cathy recalled how the couple met at university. Amanda Guard spoke to more than 1,000 people packed into Toowoomba's Empire Theatre on Sunday afternoon . 'It was while studying medicine that she acquired a skeleton from a young doctor, Roger Guard,' she said. 'When Roger turned up with the skeleton, he inadvertently locked the keys in his jeep. 'Apparently, Jill volunteered to clamber in the vehicle through a partly opened window and thus began a relationship.' Luke Johnson from the Toowoomba Road Runners humorously remembered Roger's many titles during his three decades with the club. The couple, pictured here with their children and their spouses, had called Toowoomba home for 30 years . 'He spent many years as our club president, race co-ordinator, marketing director, social convenor, course designer, chief morale officer, recruitment driver, fashion designer - yes, this is one of Roger's creations which I'm proudly modelling today for you,' he said. Neighbour and friend Sue Dowe remembered Jill's 20-year dedication to meals on wheels and her help for Sudanese migrant women through the Toowoomba Refugee and Migrant Support group. 'She possessed a huge amount of energy, a fine intelligence, compassion, generosity, modesty, good looks, a loving, caring, selfless nature and musical and artistic talent,' she said."}
{"prompt": "It comes at a premium price, but it seems organic food may not be worth shelling out for. Researchers claim it is no more nutritious than food grown using pesticides and chemicals – and won’t benefit your health. Many people pay as much as a third more for organic food in the belief that it is healthier and safer. However, Dr Dena Bravata and colleagues from Stanford University Medical Centre, California, found no clear evidence of any significant added health benefits. Is organic food healthier for you and worth the higher price tag? They also found that there was no guarantee organic food would be pesticide-free – a key attraction for many consumers – though it did have lower levels. Senior author Dr Bravata said: ‘There isn’t much difference between organic and conventional foods, if you’re an adult and making a decision based solely on your health.’ The results, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine journal, come from the biggest review yet of existing studies comparing the two types of food.  However, UK campaigners said the survey was not equipped to detect real differences. Researchers sifted through thousands of papers looking into the health benefits of organic food. The review included studies of people with organic and conventional diets, as well as research into nutrient levels, bacterial, fungal or pesticide contamination. Even if organic isn't healthier, it is still tastier in some people's eyes . Researchers found no consistent differences in the vitamin content of various foods. They also found no difference in protein or fat content between organic and conventional milk. They were also unable to identify specific fruits and vegetables for which organic appeared consistently to be the healthier choice. Certain organic foods produce higher greenhouse gas emissions than their conventional farmed counterparts . Co-researcher Crystal Smith- Spangler, who is also an instructor of medicine at Stanford’s School of Medicine, said: ‘Some believe that organic food is always healthier and more nutritious. We were a little surprised that we didn’t find that.’ The researchers did find organic produce was 30 per cent less likely to be contaminated with pesticides than conventional fruit and vegetables, but not guaranteed to be pesticide-free, while pesticide levels of all foods came within the allowable safety limits. Two studies of children found lower levels of pesticide residues in the urine of those on organic diets, though for all those studied the levels were below allowable safety thresholds. A spokesman for the Soil Association said: ‘This US study, of limited application in Europe, found organic food helps people avoid pesticides in their food. ‘However, the scientific methodology used for the review, while suitable for comparing trials of medicines, is not right for comparing different crops.’ Organic farming may not be better for the environment, according to Oxford University scientists. They found organic milk, cereals, and pork all generated higher greenhouse gas emissions than their conventionally farmed counterparts. Organic beef and olives produced lower emissions."}

As a star of Britain’s oldest television soap, he has been involved in some dramatic storylines. But it is clear that Charlie Condou’s life off-screen is equally colourful. The gay actor, who plays midwife Marcus Dent in Coronation Street, has spoken of how he became a father of two after making a pact with his straight female friend Catherine Kanter. Modern family: From left Cameron Laux, Charlie Condou, Catherine Kanter and their daughter Georgia . They agreed that if she didn’t find her ‘Mr Right’ by the time she was 40 they would embark on parenthood together. Thrown into the equation is Mr Condou’s partner Cameron Laux, 49, with all three sharing the responsibility of raising Georgia, four, and two-year-old Hal, who were born by IVF. Mr Condou, 40, said: ‘I always wanted to be a dad. When I came out to my parents as a teenager, their only concern was I might never be a father and they knew how much I wanted to be. ‘Catherine and I had the conversation I’m sure thousands of women have with their gay friends, a sort of plan-B pact – to have a child together should Mr Right not appear. I’d had other female friends ask me and it never felt right. But with Catherine it did.’ Mr Condou said he was lucky his family were supportive, as were Miss Kanter’s. He joked that the 45-year-old actress’s father had heard a similar story on The Archers, which had helped his understanding of what his daughter was doing. Miss Kanter said: ‘I was never one of those women who saw a baby and thought “I want one”, but I also knew I didn’t want to not have children. ‘When Charlie first brought up the . subject of having kids together I wasn’t opposed to the idea, but it . wasn’t how I wanted to do it. ‘I . still had hopes of The One appearing in a shaft of light and told . Charlie to come back when I was 40. Then I turned 40 and Mr Right still . hadn’t materialised, so it started to take on more meaning. I couldn’t . shake the fear that I might hit 50 and regret not trying. Strong figures: Charlie Condou, right, with partner Cameron Laux attending a Diversity Role Models Event in order to raise awareness of homophobic bullying in schools last year . ‘We had both been single when we discussed this, but then Charlie started seeing Cam. It was clear if we were to go ahead, Cam would need to be involved. And so there were three.’ Recalling their visit to the IVF clinic, Miss Kanter said it was ‘surreal – we were the only threesome in a waiting room of couples’. It took a year and four cycles of IVF before the first positive pregnancy test. Although Miss Kanter, Mr Condou and Mr Laux initially moved in together, they now live separately. Mr Condou said the children spend half their time with him and Mr Laux at their home in Islington, North London, and the rest with Miss Kanter, who lives nearby. Mr Condou said the only negative response appears to have come from a couple of gay friends, with ‘one accusing us of trying to fit into some kind of heterosexual stereotype’. In his professional life, he has been involved in a ‘gay dad’ storyline. Mr Condou joined Coronation Street in 2007 as Marcus Dent, boyfriend of barman Sean Tully, but left after three years to spend more time with his daughter. He was tempted back to the ITV soap last year to feature in a story where they looked after Sean’s son Dylan. But in recent months viewers have seen Marcus fall in love with Maria Connor, the character’s first heterosexual relationship. In the interview for Red magazine, Miss Kanter, who has appeared in EastEnders on TV and also works in the theatre, admitted the hardest part for her was dealing with the unexpected loneliness her circumstances brought on. On screen: Pictured here in 2012 as midwife Marcus Dent alongside co-stars Toby Sawyer, as Aiden Lester, left, Ryan Thomas as Jason Grimshaw, right, and Samia Smith as Maria Connor . ‘It felt like I spent the first 12 weeks of my pregnancy holding my breath,’ she said. ‘And I found it surprisingly lonely. Charlie and Cam had each other to bounce fears off, but I was on my own. Charlie was supportive, but it wasn’t the same. Those first months were harder than I anticipated. But we’ve all had our moments. ‘Charlie is the middleman, so he has to placate two people. And Cameron sometimes felt isolated because, biologically, it was happening to Charlie and me. ‘Towards the end of the pregnancy we agreed it made sense to be living together: practically, so we could all be hands on; emotionally so we all felt involved.’ Mr Condou added: ‘Something I realised early on is that I’ll never be the one who feels compromised: I’m in a relationship with Cameron and I’m the biological parent with Catherine, so my position is clear. ‘Catherine is single, so she doesn’t have someone to talk to about the kids in the way Cam and I do.’For Mr Laux his modern family set-up is a marriage with three people. ‘Or at least it’s like a friendly divorce, where the kids split their time between two homes!’ he said. ‘It works well, though.’"}
{"prompt": "(CNN) -- On October 29, Ed Shevlin looked out toward the Atlantic Ocean from his third-story apartment in New York's Rockaway Park. Sand-filled rain began pelting his windows in what sounded to him like a hundred pans of frying bacon. Then, the lights went out -- and stayed out -- for three weeks. The next morning, he awoke to a scene of utter destruction. Superstorm Sandy tore the sea town's boardwalk to pieces, and filled the community pool with saltwater. It forced 27 of his New York City Department of Sanitation co-workers out of their homes. Yet they were still first on the scene, -- clearing the roads so firemen and ambulances could enter -- reporting seven days a week for 14 hours a day. They worked around the clock to clear more than 500,000 tons of debris and rid neighbors of the unsettling reminder that their entire lives were now piles of garbage in the front yard. Little more than a month later, Ed stood on the ground floor of Madison Square Garden in quite a different setting. He and seven fellow sanitation workers were given tickets to attend the 12-12-12 Concert for Sandy Relief, the most successful fund-raising concert in history. They were heroes for their community. And now they needed help. Through stories such as Ed's, viewers around the world recognized the immediate and unprecedented need across the Northeast. Generous concert donors -- hailing from all 50 states and more than 90 countries -- gave $51 million to help organizations working on the front lines of the disaster. Robin Hood was honored to be entrusted with these funds, and we have since distributed the entire proceeds from the concert to almost 400 organizations across the tri-state area. When the storm hit, and the true depth and breadth of the devastation began to emerge, we knew that the organizations we'd traditionally funded for poverty-fighting work would already be on the ground helping victims of the storm. Rather than wait for them to come to us requesting emergency food, blankets, generators, and other time-critical supplies, we made sure they had the money right away -- providing $3 million to more than 75 organizations in just a few days. Valuable time wasn't lost, and communities such as Ed's in the Rockaways could start rebuilding. As we saw in the wake of 9/11, the need slowly transitioned from emergency assistance to longer-term rebuilding and restorative services, including counseling, benefits/legal aid (such as helping people apply for FEMA funds) and physical and mental health care. But the majority of Robin Hood funds have been devoted to housing, one of the largest and most critical areas of need across the tri-state area. In New Jersey alone, more than 72,000 homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed. And without shelter, storm victims have an even harder time getting back on their feet. Because of this, we made a $1 million grant to the Affordable Housing Alliance in Monmouth County, New Jersey, to help purchase, transport, and install 17 newly manufactured homes for low-income residents displaced by the storm. A mother of two lived in the flood evacuation zone of Sea Bright and packed up before Sandy hit. When she returned, 5 feet of water and sand filled her home. An elderly couple forced to evacuate their house had been living in a motel for months. Both families now have brand new homes and can start the process of rebuilding their lives. Once the scope of the devastation caused by Sandy became apparent, we reactivated the Robin Hood Relief Fund -- originally created to support victims of 9/11 -- to help effectively steward funds and resources. Because of the emergency nature of the situation, the Relief Fund Committee met almost every week -- 17 times in five months -- to provide guidance and review grant applications. Our goal was to allocate all of the funds from the fund, $70.5 million, as quickly and effectively as possible. In fact, we completed the process in April with a total of 494 grants to 391 different organizations. But even though our Sandy-specific resources have been spent, the need continues. Ed Shevlin's community in Rockaway Park is still not back to normal. Neighbors await much-needed federal funding. And while the state declared that storm debris collection has officially ended, Ed and his co-workers still find remnants of Sandy destruction in their daily pickups. We continue to accept donations at the Robin Hood Fund and are encouraged by the fact that dozens of other relief organizations are still on the front lines helping. Because, as Ed will tell you, the job is nowhere close to being finished."}
{"prompt": "Jackson, Mississippi (CNN) -- Investigative documents obtained by CNN show that former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, his wife and his staff may have given preferential treatment to two of the convicted murderers who were among the more than 200 former and current inmates he pardoned in January. According to the documents compiled by the office of Mississippi's attorney general, the state's former first lady, Marsha Barbour, apparently called a car dealership regarding the purchase of two vehicles for two convicted murderers -- days before they were pardoned. The cars were later delivered to the governor's mansion, two days before the men were released. CNN has also learned that a member of the governor's staff took the same two men, David Gatlin and Charles Hooker, to get their driver's licenses while they were still in state custody, before their pardons were signed and made official. \"Yes, that's true ... I did take some of them,\" said Barbour's former security chief, Wayland Adams. \"I knew that they were going to be paroled. I was assured of that and I just took them to get their driver's licenses. \"I thought that if I went ahead to get them a driver's license it would speed things up on getting them a job. And that was the only reason. I was just trying to help them.\" Adams, who retired as security director of the Mississippi governor's mansion when Barbour left office in January, told CNN the former Mississippi governor did not ask him to take Gatlin and Hooker to get their licenses. \"No, I assume full responsibility for it,\" he said. Adams admitted his actions were a bit unusual. State law enforcement experts and legal experts told CNN that while this would be considered preferential treatment for any inmate, no state laws were violated. \"Unless a person has had his or her license revoked ... they are not prohibited from acquiring or renewing a driver's license while incarcerated as long as they had domicile in the state prior to imprisonment,\" according to a written statement from Mississippi Department of Public Safety spokesman Master Sgt. Johnny Poulos. Poulos said his department was not aware of any directive from Barbour to provide licenses to the men. Either way, Randy Walker is furious. Nearly 20 years ago, he survived a gunshot wound to the head by Gatlin moments after Gatlin killed Tammy Ellis, Gatlin's estranged wife. Gatlin admitted he shot her in the head as she held their 6-week-old child in her arms. Police found the infant, still in her arms, alive and covered with blood. \"Where is enough enough?\" said Walker, who has recovered from his head wound. \"It should be enough that they gave a convicted killer his life back.\" During his last days in office in January, Gov. Haley Barbour issued pardons to more than 200 current and former inmates. Most of the pardons were granted to former inmates who had already completed their sentences and were free. However, some of the prisoners were convicted murderers. Now, the legacy of the once popular two-term governor, who considered running for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, is being questioned by some Mississippians. The pardons were challenged by Mississippi's attorney general, but last week the Mississippi Supreme Court upheld the legality of the pardons. Five of the prisoners -- including Gatlin and Hooker -- worked as trusties as part of a state rehabilitation program that allows model prisoners to work as servants and handymen at the governor's mansion. They had access to Barbour practically every day, according to people familiar with the program. Barbour has said he believes the men are no longer a threat, that they are rehabilitated and deserve a second chance at life. \"That's what we as Christians believe. My wife and I are Christians,\" he told CNN's John King on his show, \"John King, USA,\" weeks after issuing the pardons. \"When we have people who get rehabilitated ... they deserve a second chance. It's the governor's job and the governor's job alone to let them have a second chance. That's why I'm very comfortable with this.\" But no matter how one looks at this story, the benefits these convicted murderers received appear special. \"It's abhorrent that these people would be given this sort of treatment after the crimes they've committed,\" said Mississippi State Rep. David Baria. Baria, a Democrat, sponsored several bills to change Mississippi's pardons process. The bills all died in committee last week. He said the victims in the cases have put up with too much already. \"Not only to turn these folks loose but to treat them like kings, essentially -- it's outside the bounds of common decency of what we expect of our government,\" he told CNN. Gatlin and Hooker were released on January 8. They both had driver's licenses when they went to Gray Daniels Chevrolet in Jackson, Mississippi, on January 6. Records show Hooker bought a white 2007 Ford Focus while Gatlin picked up a gray Chevy HHR. Both vehicles were paid for with bank checks from Bank Plus. Both men put no money down. It remains unclear how the men were able to secure bank checks while still in the custody of the Mississippi Highway Patrol. When reached by CNN at the dealership, the salesman who sold the men the cars refused to comment. \"I am not allowed to speak about any transactions,\" he said. But the investigative reports compiled by Mississippi's attorney general's office show that Barbour's wife, Marsha Barbour, aided the transaction. In the report, the investigator writes, \"While at the dealership I spoke briefly with the salesman who stated that Marsha Barbour had contacted him regarding the purchase of vehicles for Hooker and Gatlin.\" The details of the conversation were not available and it is not clear exactly what role Marsha Barbour played in the transaction, or the nature of her relationship with the pardoned men. The report further stated that \"the inmates had been brought to the dealership on January 6, 2012, in a black Ford Crown Victoria to complete paperwork for the sale and [the investigator] stated that the prisoners had paid with certified checks issued by Bank Plus.\" According to the report, the car salesman also told investigators \"he delivered both vehicles to the governor's mansion on the afternoon of January 6, 2012.\" When investigators asked Gatlin how he got the car, he allegedly told them, according to the report, \"I can't tell you.\" When asked about the driver's licenses and the role of Marsha Barbour in the purchase of the cars, a spokeswoman for the former governor said the questions \"were based on assumptions of fact which simply are not true.\" Spokeswoman Sherry Vance did not elaborate on which aspects of this story were untrue, and has not responded to CNN's questions for clarification. Walker, the victim who stared down the barrel of Gatlin's gun before he was shot in the head, said he's \"baffled\" by the allegations and believes Barbour is financially helping the men. \"Was it because he was a trusty at the governor's mansion and he had so much time with Barbour?\" he wondered. \"It's insane that he would do that. Where's my handout?\" \"I mean, I had thousands upon thousands of medical bills that nobody helped me pay. I'd like to get some of that money back that I wasted because David shot me. I didn't ask for David to come shoot me. Where's my handout?\" he asked angrily. CNN went to Hooker's home in Jackson several times and saw the White Ford Focus mentioned in the state investigator's report parked outside his house, but Hooker did not answer his door or respond to CNN's phone calls. According to the investigative reports from the Mississippi attorney general's office, Hooker allegedly told investigators that his son helped him buy the vehicle, and that his son had already made three months of car payments for him. CNN also went to Alabama to try to get Gatlin's side of the story, and found him living in the home of Ernest Jacks. His gray Chevy HHR was in the driveway, but Jacks said Gatlin refused to talk to us. But Walker has a lot to say. He can barely contain his anger that the man who tried to kill him could get such preferential treatment. \"I've been trying for over two years, since 2009, to get a face to face with Barbour, and never got a phone call back,\" said Walker. \"Gatlin must have made quite the impression on him.\" Watch Anderson Cooper 360° weeknights 10pm ET.

Ministers claim that milk being supplied via 'middle men' has seen the Government billed up to £1 a pint – while it can be bought in shops for an average of 36p. They have warned that the cost of the scheme has doubled in four years to £53million, which could soar to £76million by 2016 unless costs are curbed. Milking it: All under-fives receive a third of a pint free each day . Public Health Minister Anne Milton said the Government would then face being overcharged £20million a year. But the review has prompted toxic . allegations of 'milk snatching' by critics who warned that it will lead . to a fall in the 1.5 million children who currently benefit from free . milk. The Government's Nursery Milk scheme . provides under-fives with a third of a pint every day. Older children . entitled to free school meals are also offered free milk. The Government's review was launched . after it emerged from the Department of Health that 'middle men' – firms . which supply nurseries, schools and childminders with milk and claim . the money back directly from the Government – were deliberately ramping . up their prices to as much as £1 a pint. One option being considering by the . Government would cap the amount that can be claimed back on a pint of . milk – which could save as much as £40million a year. Another would see a . system of national suppliers set up to cut out the middle men. Mrs Milton yesterday insisted that the Government remained committed to providing free milk for all under-fives. Rip-off: The Department of Health ended up over spending by millions after being over-charged for nursery school milk . Long history: The Government's Nursery Milk scheme, providing under fives with a third of a pint every day for free, dates back to 1940s and suggestions it would be axed in 2010 were quickly played down at the time . Margaret Thatcher, pictured here in 1970 with Prime Minister Edward Heath was nicknamed the 'milk snatcher' in 1971 . She said: 'The current scheme has not . changed operationally since it began, and costs have ballooned. In four . years, costs have jumped from £27million in 2007 to a staggering . £53million in 2011. Estimates show that modernising the scheme could . save as much as £20million each year.' The state first gave free milk to . pregnant women and young children in 1940, to protect them against . wartime shortages, and it was later extended to all schoolchildren. However, Margaret Thatcher was dubbed the 'milk snatcher' in 1971 after scrapping free school milk for the over-sevens. The nickname became shorthand for the . Tories' supposedly heartless approach to spending cuts. David Cameron . last year shot down suggestions that the free milk scheme could be axed . completely – underlining the Tories' sensitivity over the issue. But shadow public health minister . Diane Abbott said: 'Trying to cut the cost of this scheme may end up . snatching milk away from children, disproportionately affecting the . poorest. In a recession, when there is a squeeze on families, it is the . wrong time for risks with our children's health.' Jon Thornes, chairman of the School . and Nursery Milk Alliance, which is made up of a group of organisations . that campaign to retain free milk, said: 'Drinking milk in schools, . nurseries and while in the care of childminders is vital in helping . children to develop important nutrition and social habits. The Nursery . Milk scheme has proven incredibly popular and hugely successful in . contributing to the healthy development of children. 'We will be engaging fully with the . consultation to ensure the scheme continues to benefit as many children . as possible – and would urge the Government to ensure its focus is on . children's wellbeing rather than just the bottom line.' John Sedgwick, managing director of . milk provider Cool Milk, said: 'Making the scheme more burdensome for . nurseries and childminders will only serve to reduce the number of . children receiving milk. 'The risk is that the scheme will atrophy until it no longer exists. Cutting the scheme by the back door is not the answer.'"}

Arfaq Hussain, 36, from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, used his knuckles to rap the seven-year-old around the knee in what the judge described as 'unforgiveable conduct'. The offence came to light in December 2012 when another pupil told a teacher that he did not want to do PE classes at the Jame Masjid Mosque in Batley, West Yorkshire, because his legs were sore. Arfaq Hussain, 36, who was a teacher at the Jame Masjid Mosque in . Batley, West Yorkshire, has been jailed for 26 weeks after admitting . cruelty against a seven-year-old, who he hit over the knee with his . knuckles . Leeds Crown Court heard how social services spoke to both boys about the allegations. A medical examination then found six blue-coloured bruises to the side of the seven-year-old's knee. The court heard that, when the boy was questioned, he said his teacher would hit him . if he made mistakes. He said he would be told: 'You’re not reading what you are supposed to be reading.' Hussain, who has been suspended from teaching, admitted cruelty and was jailed for 26 weeks. He admitted he kept an eye on the children and reported them to the main teacher if they were naughty. Rebecca Young, defending, said it was a 'momentary lapse of control by an otherwise caring father and teacher'. Leeds Crown Court heard how social services spoke to the boy about the allegation and that six blue-coloured bruises were found on the side of his knee . She said he had not intended to cause any injured and was 'mortified' by the shame he had brought on his family and mosque. Miss Young added that a jail sentence would be difficult for his family, for whom he was the sole provider. Judge Tom Bayliss QC accepted it was a one-off offence but said his parents had trusted their son would not be harmed at the mosque. He said: 'They were entitled and the public is entitled to know that those who care for our children in whatever capacity, voluntary or paid, will not abuse them, will not injure them. 'You did injure him. It may have been only once but it was unforgiveable conduct towards a young and vulnerable child.'"}
{"prompt": "New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Police in the northern India state of Rajasthan say they were stunned when a man showed up at a police outpost holding a bloody human head in one hand and a sword in another. The head was that of the man's daughter, chopped off because of her \"indecent behavior,\" Umesh Ojha, deputy superintendent of the district police, told CNN. Investigators say the man, Oghad Singh, had paraded the head through the village on his way to the police station. Singh's daughter, Manju Kunwar, was in her 20s and was living with her parents after divorcing her husband two years ago. Her father accused her of acting indecently with other men. Family convicted in 'honor murders' Authorities say Kunwar's mother is a farmer who was working in the fields at the time and was too distraught to talk. Singh works in a marble quarry. The beheading happened on Tuesday in Dengar Ka Guda, a village in Rajsamand District about 400 kilometers, or 250 miles, from Jaipur in the state of Rajasthan. Kunwar's head and the rest of her body were cremated according to Hindu tradition, police said. India is filled with extremes on many levels, including how women are treated. In India women hold some of the highest positions in society, from company CEOs to the president and speaker of the House, but this case highlights another side of India, one in which women still suffer the consequences of long-held traditions that govern their behavior in Indian society.

{"prompt": "(CNN) -- It's a rapidly spreading pop culture phenomenon, fueled by the Internet. Korean pop music or K-pop, is one of the most notable exports to come out of South Korea in the past decade. Korea's content watchdogs say K-pop exports grew nearly 50 percent from 2011 to 2012, grossing an estimated $290 million last year. Earlier this year, nine-member K-Pop dance group Girls' Generation beat Justin Bieber, Miley Cyrus and Lady Gaga for \"Video of the Year\" at the 2013 YouTube Music Awards in early November. The girl group is making waves as part of South Korea's young generation of pop stars rising up through the international ranks. K-pop concerts sell out in minutes. They raise television ratings, and their branding can get teens, and even some adults to buy just about anything. But it is not without incredible amounts of training. Most idols train for years in singing, dancing, acting and learning Asian languages before they are even allowed to debut their first song. Mike Suh, head of strategy and global business at entertainment conglomerate CJ E&M, says idols go through a long training period \"so that they immediately attract fans when they first appear.\" That phenomenon was on display at the 2013 Mnet Asian Music Awards (MAMA for short) in Hong Kong, organized by CJ E&M, where some of South Korea's biggest idol groups Girls' Generation, BIGBANG, EXO, 2NE1 and Sistar held court. Tickets for the 10,000 seats were sold out within an hour of going on sale and nearly 13 million people signed onto MAMA's website to vote for their favorite idols. MAMA also showcased notable guests from the international music scene including Hong Kong singer/actor Aaron Kwok, Norway's Ylvis, Sweden's Icona Pop and American legend Stevie Wonder. Self-proclaimed K-Pop fan Paris Hilton also made an appearance. New pop . One of the more unique acts to go onstage was helmet-donning girl group Crayon Pop, which took home \"Best New Female Artist\" at the event. The comic act shot to fame when their music video \"Bar Bar Bar\" went viral earlier this year. At a backstage interview at MAMA, the five girls bowed politely, but were extremely careful of their actions. Showing how closely monitored they are, their manager was on high alert, often signaling to them about what they should and should not say. The practice is common among many idol groups, as any slip of the tongue can immediately damage their careers. In 2012, seven-member idol group Block B made comments in an interview about the tragic flooding in Thailand that some fans viewed as disrespectful and offensive. After a public outcry, the group issued many apologies but it wasn't enough. There were reports of music stations restricting them from appearing on its programs. Many netizens reportedly demanded their disbandment; some going as far as calling for the members to commit suicide. Former 2PM leader Jay Park also sparked public outrage after netizens found old posts on his social media site about his dislike for South Korea. The Korean-American was soon dropped from the idol group. Surveillance . Every action of an idol is monitored by their agency -- even romance can be prohibited by a clause in their contract. Singer Choi Dong-wook, known by his stage name Se7en, told a Korean talk show he saw his fan club instantly drop by about 100,000 members when he announced he had a girlfriend. Scandals can also have financial consequences. After BIGBANG leader G-Dragon tested positive for marijuana use in 2011, the group's management company YG Entertainment reduced the size of its IPO by around 10 percent. Multicultural reach . At MAMA, fans speaking Mandarin, Nepali, Tagalog and Japanese among other languages stood in the waiting areas, staring wide-eyed as the music videos of idols played over and over on the screens. The audience members knew everything about their idols -- writing down everything they said and did. It's dedication like this that keeps the K-Pop phenomenon going, and in return, artists give back forms of \"fan service\". Newer debuts like Crayon Pop appeal to fans by physically appearing before them at so-called \"high touch\" events -- more personal, face-to-face meetings that allow them to have direct interaction. \"At these events, we shake hands with fans and get their advice on what they'd like to see,\" said Crayon Pop member Cho-A. Acts also use social media as a constant window to keep fans' attention. Crayon Pop has a YouTube channel where fans can watch videos of their everyday lives -- shot and edited by their agency. The channel currently has more than 157,000 subscribers. Disconnect . Some fans, however, believe that despite these methods, the artists come off as unapproachable and distant. Fans say they want more of their idols, and they're not getting it beyond the tightly controlled images and videos. Dorothy Advincula, an assistant editor at the Korean entertainment news site Kpopstarz, calls this K-Pop's \"economics of scarcity,\" a method agencies use to try to keep the ball in their court. \"Artist agencies make it difficult for idols to relate to their fans beyond the stage performance. So the littlest sighting, the slightest glimpse with a photo or any kind of evidence becomes a sort of trophy,\" she said. Advincula points to the social media presence as a veil. \"While it's not unique to K-Pop, the response is different because there can be a disconnect on how idols and fans actually interact... while in mainstream, there is a certain consistency.\" \"I think we've come a point of no-return where because of these bite-sized contacts... naturally fans get a bit greedier and demand something more.\""}
{"prompt": "By . Alex Brummer . PUBLISHED: . 12:00 EST, 17 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:56 EST, 18 April 2013 . A stark warning that banks across the European Union need to reduce the size of their debts by an astonishing £1trillion was issued by the International Monetary Fund today. It called on banks across Europe to reduce the reliance on emergency wholesale funds provided by central bank and to rebuild their balance sheet. The failure of European banks to reform is ‘blocking economic recovery’ and starving small and medium sized businesses of vital funds they need to survive. IMF official Jose Vinals was critical of banks in the eurozone which he said were too dependent . Whereas as the United States and Britain moved speedily to reshape their banking systems post the financial crisis the Europeans have been slow to act applying sticking plasters in the shape of emergency cash arrangements provided by the European Central Bank. IMF officials cited Britain as the one country where the reform of the banks was well advanced. It expressed concern, however, that stalled progress in restoring the health of the state controlled banks – Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland – is a drag on the recovery of the British economy. Commenting on its Global Financial Stability Report a top IMF official Jose Vinals said he detected ‘blue skies’ in the global financial system some five years after the financial crash. But while he gave the Americans, the Britain and Japan praise for tackling the issues he was critical of the eurozone for failing to deal with ‘legacy’ issues of the debt build up and strengthening the balance sheets of its banks. He accused banks in the eurozone of having become ‘too dependent’ on the wholesale funds some of which have been provided under guarantee by the European Central Bank. The IMF pressed the case for ‘decisive’ action in Europe if there was to be recovery and this included the establishment of a ‘fully fledged banking union.’ ‘We do not yet have healthy banks,’ the IMF’s top financial analyst said. The IMF expressed concern about the health of the state controlled banks Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland . Although eurozone leaders have pledged themselves to banking union precious little action has been taken as markets have calmed down. Progress also has been halted by the upcoming German elections, the political stalemate in Italy and the worsening shape of the French economy. The Fund officials expressed strong fears that recovery among Europe’s weakest economies, Greece, Spain and Portugal, was being held up by the appalling state of the banking system. ‘Credit is not flowing in the euro area periphery,’ Vinals said. The IMF also expressed concerns that even though the legacy issues of the ‘great recession’ had not yet even though legacy issues of the great recession have not fully been dealt with there are new crises on the horizon. Vinals gave his support to the contentious Cyprus rescue package noting that it was important in bank crises, post the crash, that private holders of bank debts – in Cyprus’s case the large depositors – paid a price as well as the taxpayers. He described the situation in Cyprus as being unique to that country. The Fund expressed concern that now that the banking crisis is all but over in the United States, where it began with the sub-prime meltdown in 2007-2008, that it was already returning to bad habits. Companies and private equity firms were rushing to raise cheap debt for takeovers without making the proper checks or putting in the right safeguards. The IMF is worried that ‘pension funds and insurance companies’ are taking excessive risks. Similarly, the money being printed in the US, Britain and other advances countries is ‘spilling over into emerging markets’ exposing fast growing economies to currency risks and rising debt. This has raised the prospect of volatile capital flows that in turn could lead to currency wars."}

{"prompt": "(CNN) -- Desperately overcrowded, unsanitary, seething with tension and violence. Hours after a fatal fire swept through a prison in the central Honduran city of Comayagua, killing more than 300 people, an ugly picture is emerging of the harsh state of prisons in the country. And while the cause of the fire in Comayagua is not yet clear, observers say the conditions in which its inmates live are likely to have contributed to the high death toll. Ron W. Nikkel, president of Prison Fellowship International, an international nongovernmental organization, says Comayagua is the worst prison he's visited in the country. \"It's horrifically overcrowded. The bunks are sometimes five, six, seven tiers high, with the lowest person on the totem pole sleeping underneath the bunk on the bottom,\" he told CNN from Washington. \"I've seldom been anywhere where I've seen such overcrowding. There have been a number of fires over the years and it's surprising it hasn't been worse or happened sooner than this. \"You wouldn't have congestion like that in a dog pound, it's so bad -- and very little ventilation, so I can imagine a lot of the guys died from smoke inhalation.\" The conditions in the packed, airless dormitories are oppressive, depressing and inhuman, he said. \"You wonder how the human person can adapt to living in those conditions, but they do.\" The fact that the fire broke out overnight means most of the prison's 850 inmates would have been asleep as the flames took hold. And once the alarm was raised, the authorities' response is likely to have been hampered by short staffing and poor staff training, said professor Andrew Coyle of the International Center for Prison Studies at the University of Essex in the United Kingdom. Many prisons across Central America are run-down, with crumbling infrastructure and poor maintenance, Coyle told CNN. An inevitable consequence is lax adherence to health and safety guidelines and fire prevention, making the chances of a devastating fire that much higher, he said. Nationwide, Honduras -- a country of about 8 million -- has capacity for about 8,000 prisoners but had nearly 12,000 incarcerated as of 2010, equating to 40% overcrowding, Coyle said. The U.S. State Department raised concerns in a report last year, citing human rights groups as saying prisoners \"suffered from severe overcrowding, malnutrition, and lack of adequate sanitation,\" and highlighting issues of violence and abuse. The Comayagua blaze was the third fatal prison fire in recent years. In 2003, 61 prisoners were killed in a fire at a prison in La Ceiba. In 2004, the death toll was 107 from a fire in a San Pedro Sula prison. The country's prison commissioner said authorities are looking into whether a short circuit sparked the latest fire or if a prisoner perhaps set a mattress on fire. But questions are bound to be asked about the effectiveness of the authorities' response. Human rights group Amnesty International called for a full and impartial investigation into what happened at Comayagua on Wednesday. \"The government must also take urgent steps to ensure that crucial lessons are learned and prison conditions are improved, so that such a tragedy does not occur again,\" said Esther Major, Central America Researcher at Amnesty. Another rights group, Human Rights Watch, pointed the finger at overcrowding and criticized the Honduran authorities for failing to address the conditions in which suspects and convicts are held. \"Endemic violence, the very poor infrastructure, poor staffing, badly trained staff -- all of these factors combined means that when something goes wrong, there's a grave danger of loss of life and inability of the authorities to cope,\" Coyle said. Gang membership is also an issue in the region's prisons, said Coyle. Prisoners who don't already belong to a gang, or mara, when they enter jail soon sign up as a matter of survival. Nikkel says that from what he's seen, a majority of the inmates at Comayagua are young men aged 18 to 25 and many are affiliated with gangs. About half are being held pre-trial, so they have not yet had their cases heard in court, let alone been sentenced. Some may spend years waiting, a sign of the country's painfully slow judicial process, Nikkel said. That adds to the sense of injustice and pent-up frustration in prison. While he said he hasn't seen violence between inmates or on the part of prison staff during his visits, Nikkel said it is widely reported. \"You can certainly see the tension when you go in with regards to the stand-off between various gangs controlling certain areas,\" he said. \"But Honduras has been notorious for the violence of the system against inmates, and part of that is due to the inadequate training of prison officers but also because they are subjected to the same overcrowding, which in these conditions is very difficult at the best of times.\" Comayagua's prison director was shot last year by gang members unhappy with the restrictions placed on their compatriots inside the prison, Nikkel said. Sanitation in that prison is woefully inadequate, he added, with \"awful\" washing and toilet facilities. Drugs are as easily available inside prison as on the streets, Nikkel added. Corruption is also a big problem, with those who have powerful gang connections on the outside able to call the shots. \"I've seen guards providing women for prostitution to inmates in an organized way, very open, so the whole thing is seething with endemic corruption that feeds the violence,\" Nikkel said. A similar situation exists in other Central American countries, he said. \"With the gangs being able to pay more to the guards than the guards are getting in salaries, the power is where the money is.\" While there has been much talk of taking on the corruption in the prison sector, Nikkel said, the chances of it are slim while other parts of civil society are also riddled with corruption. Staff and volunteers with Prison Fellowship International are working to provide education and practical projects, such as growing food, to combat the chronic lack of anything for inmates to do, Nikkel said, and to give them some hope. The organization also runs a program that sends medical teams into the country's prisons to treat such ailments as skin and dental problems, eye infections, and malnutrition, he said. Coyle says there is recognition across most of the region that the current prison conditions are unacceptable, in terms of violence and poor infrastructure, but many obstacles lie in the way of reform. \"You cannot reform a prison system in isolation from the rest of civil society -- and where civil society is violent and dangerous and destructive, it's no great surprise that it extends into the rest of the prison.\""}
{"prompt": "(CNN) -- Skywatchers are gathering from parking lots in western India to music festivals on remote Japanese islands to witness what NASA describes as an \"exceptionally long\" total solar eclipse that will cross half the planet on Wednesday. People try out \"solar view goggles\" ahead of the eclipse on the outskirts of Ahmedabad, India. \"This eclipse has the potential to be observed by more people than any eclipse in all of history,\" said MIT astronomer Richard Binzel, who will be in Shanghai leading an expedition of observers and a group of eclipse chasers.   \"Essentially, every inhabitant of all of India and China will be able to see at least part of the sun covered throughout the day,\" he said. The path of the total eclipse will stretch across the heart of Asia -- from India's Bay of Cambay, over the Himalayas and across China and the southern islands of Japan. The eclipse is expected to reach its peak over India at around 12:40 a.m. GMT Wednesday (8:40 p.m. ET Tuesday). Though the duration of greatest eclipse will occur over the Pacific Ocean at six minutes, 39 seconds, people in some areas of China and Japan will experience up to more than six minutes of darkness, according to predictions by Fred Espenak of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and J. Anderson of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada.  Watch as eclipse-watchers head to China » . The 15,150-kilometer (9,415-mile) journey of the moon's shadow across the Earth will last nearly three-and-a-half hours and be \"one of the longest eclipses, if not the longest eclipse, in this century,\" Binzel said. Forecasters predict stormy weather for Wednesday morning in Shanghai, but this prognosis has not deterred astronomers and tourists from flooding the city. Send us your photos of the eclipse . Professor Zhao Junliang of the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory said the weather could be unpredictable but staying away from such an historic event would be a mistake. \"In 1987, I chased a total solar eclipse in (the western region of) Xinjiang. At the time, the sun was entirely blocked by stormy clouds. Two minutes before the eclipse began, the clouds suddenly cleared,\" Zhao said. \"You just never know, so you have to go.\" Read blog on how eclipse-chasers are gambling on weather . Rick Gille and his wife flew in from Atlanta, Georgia, to catch the eclipse in Shanghai. They were heading to what is known as the \"centerline\" -- where the eclipse will last nearly six minutes. They are armed with high resolution digital cameras and telescopes. \"You'll know us when you see us,\" said Gille, who travels the world chasing solar eclipses. \"We're all wearing beige t-shirts which read 'Eclipse 2009.'\" Total eclipses happen about once a year or a little less often somewhere on the Earth's surface and are visible in a narrow band, Benzil said. \"This band starts at sunrise in India and ends at sunset over the Pacific, just east of Hawaii about four hours later. The shadow path of the moon is sweeping across the surface of the Earth at about 3,000 kilometers per hour,\" he said. \"The partial eclipse is also visible throughout Thailand and Vietnam, as far south at the top tip of Australia and as far north as Siberia.\" In some cultures, legends and folklore surrounds eclipses. In India, an eclipse is considered inauspicious. Women forbid pregnant daughters-in-law from going outside out of the belief that their children could be born with marks. Some temples won't offer any prayers on the day of an eclipse -- such as the one next to the planetarium in Mumbai, which said it won't even light a stick of incense. In Chinese tradition, there is a story about a heavenly dog eating the sun. As the story goes, people would make noise to scare off the dog and rescue the sun, said Bill Yeung, president of the Hong Kong Astronomical Society. \"In ancient China, we shared the same impression with our Indian friends that a solar eclipse was not a good thing,\" he told CNN. Some of the more unusual ways to see Wednesday's eclipse include a cruise ship that will travel along the centerline off Japan and from aboard a 737-700 chartered plane in India. \"The aircraft will be intercepting the middle of the eclipse shadow at 0626 IST (Indian Standard Time) at a height of 41,000 feet,\" travel company Cox and Kings India Ltd, which is organizing the flight in association with Space technology and education Ltd, said in a statement. \"Eclipse chasers sitting along the Sun Side seats of the aircraft will be able to photograph the eclipse; while the chasers sitting along the Earth Side seats will be able to photograph the Lunar Shadow moving over the Earth cloud top,\" the company said. More conventional viewing parties in Shanghai have been planned along the beach, in a park and in skyscrapers. A music festival has been organized in Japan's Amami island, with more than 6,000 people expected, and Japanese television has shown rows of tents set up on Akusekijima island. The witnesses of the eclipse will range \"from the farmer who only knows legends of eclipses and may not know this is happening at all to the world's experts who have come specifically to the Shanghai region to make the most detailed scientific analysis possible,\" added Binzel, the MIT astronomer. For James and Kathy Scheffler of Kokomo, Indiana, solar eclipses are not to be missed. They have seen six eclipses, including in Aruba, the Black Sea, Madagascar and the Egyptian-Libyan border, and are now making their way to Shanghai. \"When it happens, there is this dissonance that is set up between what your body knows is supposed to be light and what your eyes are seeing -- it's suddenly gotten dark. It's a very, very strange feeling that some people have likened to a religious experience, and you get kind of addicted to that,\" said James Scheffler, a cardiologist. \"It's a very interesting emotional experience as well as the beauty of the event.\" Kathy Scheffler added: \"It's an experience that, first of all very few people in the world will see it, and second of all, it's a once in a lifetime -- ever -- experience that you can't ever duplicate because they are all so different.\" CNN's John Vause, Nishi Kumar, Yoko Wakatsuki, Stephanie Akiko Haschke and Mallika Kapur contributed to this report."}

Mrs Obama's chief of staff Tina Tchen, who is a first-generation Chinese-American, told The New York Times that the family trip featuring three-generations of the Robinson family will be appreciated by the Chinese because of the importance they place on tradition. This is both Mrs Obama and the girls' first trip in China- and Mrs Obama's third international trip without her husband since becoming First Lady. They were welcomed by the Chinese First Lady Peng Liyuan. Recent run-in: Sasha was not wearing a brace when she was last pictured as they returned to the White House after the family's Christmas vacation in Hawaii . Fashion aficionados have always keyed into Mrs Obama's sartorial choices but as the girls have grown up- both in age and in height- they have become trendsetters in their own right. Malia, 15, and Sasha wore similar high waisted skating-style skirts as they deplaned Tuesday, with Sasha opting for a red velvet version while Malia chose the glitzy route with a silver pleated option.

{"prompt": "(CNN) -- It is easy to criticize zoos and aquariums when healthy animals are culled, particularly when they are from endangered species. It's not always easy to understand the logic behind such a decision, but to get a picture of why good zoos take particular actions, one has to understand the context and the alternatives. Wild populations of animals are collapsing at an alarming rate. Since 1997, for example, the population of giraffes in Africa has plummeted by more than 50%, with two subspecies becoming extinct in the wild, and leaving only 240 members of another subspecies in a single population center. This pattern is replicated all over the world; it is driven by our increasing need for natural resources such as palm oil, agricultural land, or living space. Animal reserves in the most vulnerable areas are struggling to protect their animals from the scourge of poachers, while other habitats are destroyed by the effects of deforestation and increasingly climate change, a problem that all of the world's governments acting in concert have been unable to check even slightly. Indeed, governments have been unable even to uphold their obligations under the Aichi Targets to assist in the protection of endangered species and to teach their populations about the value of biological diversity, obligations that have been almost entirely outsourced to zoos and museums. Zoos inherited a legacy of animal keeping from a previous age that did not understand the havoc we are wreaking on the planet. Since the establishment of national and regional zoo associations and the dawning of greater scientific understanding of our effect on nature, zoos have become essentially a last line of defense in the protection of animals. Do we wish that humans would stop destroying the natural habitats of wild animals? Of course; but this is not happening. Our choice then is clear: Do we use the legacy we inherited to protect animals from human activity, or do we leave them to take their chances, knowing that their chances of survival are slim and for many species almost impossible? If we accept that some action is better than none, then we also have to accept that managing viable populations of animals over the long term until their habitats are stabilized requires some difficult decisions, including the culling of healthy animals that won't help the species stay adaptable and immune to disease. It's worth remembering that some of the world's foremost biologists, population biologists, animal geneticists and other experts have thought deeply and philosophically about these choices. Faced with the alternatives, it's not hard to see why they chose as they did. Say we did stop zoos from breeding and transformed them into \"sanctuaries\"; Immediately we would need to give up the notion that we can save our most endangered species from extinction -- the infrastructure in the wild just isn't there for some species and in many EAZA zoos we care for species that are already extinct in the wild. Next we would need to decide what to do with the animals: Should we keep them in these new sanctuaries, unable to breed, until they die? Animal rights organizations would like to make sure that nobody enjoys seeing such animals and learning about them from zoo visits, yet these visits are what pay for everything we do, from education through to conservation. Over 1.5 billion visits will be made to EAZA zoos during the Decade of Biodiversity, with all of those visitors learning about nature. Who would be there to offer nature conservation education if zoos did not exist? Zoos in reputable zoo associations worldwide are the fourth largest donors to conservation in the wild; are animal rights groups going to replace the hundreds of millions of dollars that zoos currently donate? No, because ultimately they do not care whether species have a future in the wild. We cannot possibly release all of our animals back into a wild that is under siege, and which they would have to share with wild populations that are as large as their habitats can currently accommodate. Who would carry out the Aichi Target obligations which all European nations have signed up to? Would taxpayers really be willing to foot larger bills to pay for this, or would we, again, face abandoning animals and biodiversity to their fate, without any idea of the consequences this could bring? EAZA strongly believes that the humane and considered response is to make a real effort to save endangered species. We cannot sit on the sidelines pretending that there is a magical solution to the crisis in nature, as animal rights groups do. Serious problems require serious responses. As yet, anti-zoo activists have put forward no serious alternatives; we would be interested to hear them, but we can't afford to wait. READ MORE: While there are zoos, the killing will go on .

{"prompt": "'Drugged': Yemeni prisoner Samir Naji . A Guantanamo Bay inmate has described how he is still being subjected to horrific treatment at the notorious jail despite being cleared for release four years ago. Samir Naji told how he had been drugged, threatened with rape and forced to watch videos of other detainees being abused at the prison in Cuba which Barack Obama has promised – but so far failed – to close down. The Yemeni has been imprisoned for nearly 13 years after being accused of serving in Osama bin Laden’s security detail. He was cleared for release in 2009 but remains in the US detention facility with 135 other inmates. Mr Naji released a first-person account of his experience inside Guantanamo through his lawyers. He said he was subjected to ‘dirty and sadistic’ abuse by guards who took turns trampling over his back and forced him to watch pornography, which is against his Islamic beliefs. The inmate wrote that his story ‘starts and ends in the silence of a tiny, freezing cold cell, alone’. His account, published by CNN, continued: ‘The cell door opens. The next session, seemingly the 100th in a row. I think my first period of interrogation lasted three full months. 'Two teams of interrogators running shifts, day and night. Each session begins with shouting, to wake me up. Then they hit me on the face and the back. I am so desperate for sleep, my head is swimming.’ Mr Naji described how the room he was in had photographs of faces stuck to the walls. ‘They demand that I identify the individuals, but I can barely focus to see if I might know them. ‘The shouting and the insults get louder, and then they nod to a man in the corner. He injects me twice in the arm with some unknown substance. It’s the last thing I know.’ The inmate also described how the guards had entered his cell, ‘making awful honking noises, like wild animals’. He added: ‘I tried to refuse to eat the little food they bring me, in protest at all this. Truth: A US Senate report revealed the horrifying scale of torture operations at Guantanamo Bay, pictured . 'The interrogator laughs at me, but then turns angry; he swears loudly, and pours an army meal pack over my head. They tell the man in the corner to start feeding me intravenously. He inserts the tube in two different places on my arm and makes it bleed.’ Mr Naji continued: ‘The cell door opens. This time the guards push me on the floor and take turns trampling over my back. ‘I tell the interrogators that I can’t face not eating any more. They throw food on the floor of the room and tell me to eat like a pig. They won’t let me go to the restroom. They watch as it gets more painful, and laugh as they get the translator to describe how they will rape me if I pee in my pants.’ On another occasion, he said, the guards took him to ‘a sort of cinema room’. He added: ‘I have to watch videos of other prisoners being abused. Inmates were made to stand in stress positions, and some were waterboarded and 'rectally infused' 'Then they tell me that I have to dance for them, and run in circles whilst they pull on my chains. Every time I try and refuse, they touch me in my most private areas.’ Mr Naji said that four years ago, his case had been reviewed by six US security agencies. ‘Their conclusion? That I was innocent of any crime and should be released. ‘America cannot keep hiding from its past, and its present, like this. Our stories, and our continued detention, cannot be made to disappear.’"}
{"prompt": "Once he had dismissed defeat as an unfortunate ‘anomaly’ and, childishly, the fault of the ball boys, Jose Mourinho sought necessary to declare what his team had failed to prove on the pitch – ‘We are better than anybody else’. The Premier League table, of course, supports his assertion. But, for the second successive weekend in the North-East, the Chelsea boss was on the defensive. Five points have been surrendered at Sunderland and now Newcastle, the gap to Manchester City shrunk from eight to three. VIDEO Scroll down to see Mourinho blame the Newcastle ball boys . Jose Mourinho was unhappy with the ball boys during the latter stages of Chelsea's match at Newcastle . Chelsea were condemned to their first defeat of the season after two goals from Papiss Cisse . Mourinho, however, felt the need to serve a reminder amid the hyperbole of their first defeat of the season. ‘We are top of the league,’ he said. ‘Nobody has done better than us. Everyone would like to be in our position. So we are more than fine. We are better than anybody else.’ But they were not better than Newcastle, proof that resistance resides within a league which many expected them to waltz through undefeated. In the course of seven days, Gus Poyet - who stifled the league leaders in a goalless draw - and Alan Pardew have co-authored the manual on how to contain and expose the title favourites - it should be on the wish-list of every top-flight manager this Christmas. John Terry can only watch on as Cisse's strike hits the back of the Chelsea net at St James' Park . Cisse tucks away his second goal against Chelsea on Saturday - a huge three points for Newcastle United . Mourinho, though, will not be penning the foreword in support of the uprising. ‘We were unlucky. It is as simple as that. The best team lost. The team that tried to win, lost,’ he sounded. Jose Mourinho has never won in the Premier League at St James’ Park, losing three times and drawing once . ’For people like me who have been in football for so long you have to accept this anomaly. ‘Newcastle did what they always do. They defended. They fought hard. They tried to counter attack when it was possible. This is the way they play against us.’ Mourinho’s gripe was not merely confined to the grown men on the pitch, but also the young boys around its perimeter. Bizarrely, he criticised the speed at which they returned the ball – at one point, two appeared - as the visitors chased parity during what was a generous helping of six minutes added time, insisting that he himself would never encourage such tactics. Mourinho looked frustrated on the bench at St James' Park, but insisted his side are still the best . Rookie goalkeeper Jak Alnwick (left) celebrates with his Newcastle team-mates after they beat Chelsea . The excuse lacked substance and, indeed, class. ‘Things were happening that the referee cannot control,’ he said. ‘He cannot punish the ball boy that disappears. ‘You may as well put a cow in the middle of the pitch, walking. And then stop the game because there was a cow. You cannot do just anything in football. You have to defend. You have to defend with your 10 men, put the 10 in front of the goal line, bring the bus, but football needs a ball, not two or zero. Do what you can to win, but not everything.’ If the attack was designed to deflect attention from his players, it worked. But amid all of the bull about cows and ball boys, it should not be forgotten that Chelsea’s offensive threat has gone cold in the chill of Wearside and Tyneside. On Saturday they could not break down a team which included second-choice goalkeeper Rob Elliot and then his rookie understudy Jak Alnwick, and was also reduced to 10 men following Steven Taylor’s dismissal. Mourinho also praised the Newcastle supporters at St James' Park, labelling them a 'good, good crowd' The scorer of Newcastle’s goals, Papiss Cisse, has been troubled by injury problems of late but was still too sharp for John Terry and Gary Cahill in poaching his match-winning brace. Diego Costa, meanwhile, has scored just one in four since returning from a hamstring layoff and the Brazilian-born striker was shackled by Argentine Fabricio Coloccini at St James’ Park. The recent absence was designed to rid him of his lingering fitness issues but has instead stalled the momentum which saw him smash 10 goals in his first 12 games. Mourinho concedes his £32million marksman is not firing right now. ‘He has to improve his condition,’ he said. ‘He was injured, he had many doubts and he had a long time without training and that obviously must have an effect on a player – the way he runs, the way he moves, his coordination. He has to recover but I don't think there is any problem. For me, the problem is not the goals. The goals will come as a consequence of his condition.’ Mourinho looked disappointed during his interview with BT Sport after the game, bemoaning the ball boys . VIDEO Mourinho accepts 'unlucky' defeat . Last week, at Sunderland, Chelsea also failed to take all three points after a 0-0 draw at the Stadium of Light . Mourinho, it appears, will wait for Costa to come good, evidenced by his decision to restore him to the starting XI ahead of midweek scorers Loic Remy and Didier Drogba, who headed hope of a comeback following his second-half introduction. It was, though, in vain and Chelsea - who entertain Sporting Lisbon on Wednesday having already qualified for the Champions League knockout rounds - must now bid for a return to winning ways in the league at home to struggling Hull next weekend. Mourinho was critical of the atmosphere inside Stamford Bridge last month, likening it to an ‘empty stadium’. But that was one concession he was prepared to make about the passion and noise at St James’. ‘They are a good, good crowd,’ he said. ‘They are very enthusiastic. That is big. That is their way of living the game.’ At last there was a touch of humility to accompany defeat. At this point, however, he chose to cut short his post-match reflection - praise for anyone other than his players is not something which rests easy with Mourinho. For they, at least according to him, are still better than anybody else."}

The European Commission is concerned that authorities in Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg gave the companies preferential treatment in breach of EU rules. If they are found to have avoided tax, the three multi-national giants could face huge bills covering the past ten years. Tax probe: Customers test iPads at the Apple store at the Confluence shopping centre in Lyon, France . Last night, experts said the multi-national giants could be hit with ‘horrendous’ bills. Joaquin Almunia, the EC vice president in charge of competition policy said: ‘In the current context of tight public budgets, it is particularly important that large multinationals pay their fair share of taxes.’ Algirdas Semeta, commissioner for taxation added that ‘fair tax competition is essential for the integrity of the single market.’ The probe marks an escalation of attempts to stamp out tax avoidance by big companies, which has risen up the political agenda in recent years. Apple and Starbucks are among a number of US giants accused of avoiding tax for years through elaborate networks of subsidiaries. Other big names in the spotlight include Google and Amazon. The EC’s intervention comes after a US senate probe last year revealed Apple had sheltered billions of dollars in profits from tax by using ‘ghost companies’ registered in Cork which  were not resident in  any country for tax purposes. This has allowed it to pay no corporation tax on international sales, including in the UK. By channelling sales through Irish companies the Senate Committee found the California based company paid no corporation tax to any country on £18bn in profits made outside the US between 2009 and 2012. Starbucks has also found itself at the centre of a political storm after it emerged it had only paid corporate tax in the UK once in 15 years of trading, despite racking up more than £3billion of sales. Starbucks told a UK parliamentary investigation in 2012 that it received a tax deal in the Netherlands which allowed it to enjoy a ‘very low’ tax rate. It caved in to public pressure in December 2012 and agreed to pay £20m of corporation tax over two years to the UK government whether or not it reports a profit. Workers package boxes to be sent to customers in the Amazon  Fulfilment Centre at Rugeley, Staffordshire . Richard Murphy, of Tax Research UK said: ‘These companies are guilty of blatant tax avoidance that undermines their local competition. They could be hit with horrendous fines. ‘Hopefully this will help create a level level playing field on tax which would be good news for every honest business based in the UK.’ But an Apple spokesman said: ‘We have received no selective treatment from Irish officials. Apple is subject to the same tax laws as scores of other international companies doing business in Ireland.’ A Starbucks spokesman said: ‘We comply with all relevant tax rules, laws, and OECD guidelines and we’re studying the Commission’s announcement related to the state aid investigation in the Netherlands.’ Last night they received the backing of business leaders in the UK, with influential lobby group the Institute of Directors accusing the EC of using its state aid rules as a ‘political weapon’ to increase its influence on the tax affairs of EU members. Allie Renison, trade and Europe policy adviser, said: ‘There is a risk here that the Commission is trying to be seen to be doing something about corporate tax compliance by inserting itself into the sovereign tax affairs of individual member states under the cover of concern about state aid infringement.’ She added: “There is a legitimate discussion to be had about tackling perceived tax avoidance, but conflating different debates is not the way to do it. The EU must not put politics ahead of economics.’"}

{"prompt": "(CNN)  -- Within the last month, our country has witnessed two senseless, high-profile acts of criminal violence that would have been labeled terrorism if brown-skinned Arab Muslim men with foreign-sounding names had committed them. Because two white men committed these acts of violence, however, our political and media chattering class never used the word \"terrorism\" in its discussions. Most recently, John Patrick Bedell, a 36-year-old man from California, walked up to two security guards outside the Pentagon Metro station in suburban Washington and started shooting. He was then shot and killed. According to The Christian Science Monitor, Bedell appeared \"to have been a right-wing extremist with virulent anti-government feelings\" and also battled mental illness before his shooting rampage. A few weeks ago, on February 18, another white anti-government extremist named Joseph Stack flew his small airplane into an Internal Revenue Service building in Austin, Texas,  killing two people and injuring 13 others. According to media reports, Stack had left behind a disjointed suicide letter in which he expressed his hatred of our American government and outlined grievances with the IRS, chillingly stating that \"violence not only is the answer; it is the only answer.\" Both the Pentagon Metro and IRS attacks come at a time of \"explosive growth in [domestic] extremist-group activism across the United States,\" according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. A recently released law center report showed so-called patriot groups -- steeped in anti-government conspiracy theories -- grew from 149 in 2008 to 512 in 2009 -- a 244 percent increase that the Southern Poverty Law Center report judged to be an \"astonishing\" rise in the one-year period since President Obama took the oath of office. The number of these groups that are domestic extremist paramilitary militias grew from 42 in 2008 to 127 in 2009, the report said. Even so, for any reasonable observer who is still skeptical about labeling the recent Pentagon area shooting and IRS attack terrorism, keep one thing in mind: . Let us imagine that these Pentagon and IRS attacks had been committed by an olive-skinned Arab Muslim man named Ali Muhammad. Our national media and political commentators would have wasted little time in calling both of these acts terrorism, and some might have also called for the closings of other IRS and federal government office buildings around the country as a necessary counter-terrorism safety precaution. Instead, shortly after the IRS plane attack, some prominent media commentators immediately asked why people -- especially conservatives on the right -- were not calling the IRS attacker a terrorist. \"If this had been done by a brownish-looking Muslim guy whose suicide note paralleled Islamist political themes,\" wrote media commentator Matthew Yglesias, then right-wingers would \"demand that anyone who refused to label the attack 'terrorism' be put up on treason charges.\" In a recent piece, Robert Wright, of the New America Foundation, wrote: \"In common usage, a 'terrorist' is someone who attacks in the name of a political cause and aims to spread terror -- to foster fear that such attacks will be repeated until grievances are addressed.\" Following suit, the IRS attacker's suicide manifesto  before his aerial kamikaze attack reads in part: \"I know there have been countless before me and there are sure to be as many after ... I can only hope that the numbers quickly get too big to be whitewashed and ignored\" -- at which point, God willing, -- \"the American zombies wake up and revolt.\" If this same above-mentioned suicide letter had been instead written by an Arab Muslim man named Ali Muhammad right before crashing his airplane into an IRS building, most of the right-wing blogosphere would instantaneously erupt with screaming headlines of another act of Muslim terrorism. Because Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber; Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh; Atlanta, Georgia,  Olympic bomber Eric Rudolph; the Pentagon shooter and IRS attacker were all white men motivated by their respective ideologies, surprisingly, the term \"terrorism\" has never seemed to stick to any of them. To prove my point even further, the recently indicted American woman Colleen LaRose, who called herself \"Jihad Jane,\" can rightfully be termed a wanna-be terrorist. But why does this not apply to other white extremists? If our nation is truly conducting a ''war on terror'' and not a \"war on Islam,\" it is our duty as Americans of all colors, political persuasions and nationalities to condemn and distance ourselves from all acts of terrorism, regardless of the race or religion of those who commit violent acts in the name of extreme ideology. Simply put, terrorism is terrorism, whether it is committed by a white, black or brown person anywhere in the world. If we as a nation fail to adequately condemn all acts of terrorism equally, the only clear message that we will be sending to the rest of the world is that the word \"terrorist\" applies only to those with olive skin and foreign-sounding last names.

{"prompt": "Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- A new restored version of \"Modern Times,\" one of the greatest films in the Hollywood canon, has recently been released. The film, which came out in 1936, vividly captured the anxieties that gripped industrial workers at the height of the Great Depression. Unfortunately, the comedy works as well today as it did over seventy years ago, another sign that all is not well with our economy. In the opening scene, viewers see the Little Tramp, played by Charlie Chaplin, working on an assembly line. Many generations of viewers have laughed as they watched Chaplin try to keep up with the mind-numbing repetition of bolts that must be tightened as they make their way to him on the conveyer belt. Whenever he or his co-workers stop, for even a second, they must frantically scramble to catch up. Chaplin suffers a nervous breakdown and is placed in a hospital. His misfortune continues. When the Little Tramp leaves the hospital, he steps right into the front lines of a communist march. He is mistaken as one of the leaders of the protest. He is arrested and thrown into jail. The Little Tramp eventually escapes during a jail break. Much of the rest of the film follows the Little Tramp and his girlfriend, the Gamine, as they imagine a life of middle-class luxuries. The two break into a department store one night, experiencing what it would be like to enjoy all the new goods that were being offered in the emerging world of mass consumption. In one scene, the Tramp and the Gamine rest by a tree outside a nice neighborhood, watching a couple say goodbye. \"Can you imagine us in a little home like that?\" the caption reads. They think about what it must be like before a policeman tells them to move along. Later, they have a chance to live their dreams, but they must do so in a broken-down shanty where the walls fall over and a wood plank keeps crashing down on Chaplin's head from the ceiling. This is their reality. \"Modern Times\" seems all too familiar for many Americans who are living through an economic nightmare in 2010. Although working conditions for many Americans have vastly improved since the 1930s and citizens can count on certain basic provisions upon their retirement, current economic conditions have created the same kind of despair captured by Chaplin in this film. Other than the upper-income Americans who are enjoying the fruits of a rebounding stock market, most are struggling to survive with an unemployment rate hovering at 9.5 percent (and an underemployment rate, which includes the unemployed and those working part-time seeking full-time work, that is over 19 percent). They are fearful about keeping their jobs if they have one, obtaining jobs if they don't, being able to pay for their family's needs, saving for retirement, and facing local and state governments cutbacks in essential services such as school programs. Yet politicians are not dealing with this crisis and the private sector has not offered solutions. The problem is much deeper than the recession. The stagnant unemployment rates have been produced by a number of forces that have long been brewing in the economy. For decades, businesses have been shifting their plants overseas. They have been setting up shop in places where labor is cheap and unions are nonexistent. While much of this shift began with factory jobs, a growing number of white-collar jobs have left as well. The U.S. has fallen behind in many sectors of the economy such as clean energy and is even starting to feel competition in once-dominant sectors such as science. Public policy, as many scholars have shown, has combined with globalization to undercut the security that many Americans had enjoyed in the post-World War II era, at the same time that income inequality has vastly increased. Rising medical and educational costs have squeezed the financial resources of families as they face these challenges. There will continue to be a debate about which are the most important factors behind the current crisis, but the outcome is indisputable. American workers are struggling. Velma Hart is a poignant example. Hart was the woman who confronted President Obama when she asked, \"I've been told that I voted for a man who said he's going to change things in a meaningful way for the middle class ... I'm waiting ... Is this my new reality?\" Unfortunately, Hart found out her answer when she was laid off by a nonprofit organization in Maryland. According to the national director of the organization where she worked, \"It's not anything she did. She got bit by the same snake that has bit a lot of people. It was a move to cut our bottom line. Most not-for-profits are seeing their money pinched.\" Too many of the nation's workers are finding themselves right back where Chaplin's character was in 1936. Ultimately, many Americans did experience better lives when the New Deal stabilized conditions and increased government spending in World War II helped stimulate the economy. Innovation and public-private partnerships resulted in a vibrant period for the American economy during the 1950s and 1960s, one that the historian James Patterson has characterized as an era of \"Grand Expectations.\" Today the political system seems paralyzed in its efforts to find ways to regenerate the economy. As a new generation of Americans are exposed to the film for the first time, they might find themselves laughing a bit too hard and seeing a little of themselves in Chaplin's shoes. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian E. Zelizer."}
{"prompt": "Two prominent black Democrats in the House of Representatives are vowing to skip Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to Congress next month, a move that a White House insider says was put in motion by the Obama administration. John Lewis of Georgia and G.K. Butterfield of North Carolina both said Friday that they disapproved when House Speaker John Boehner invited the Israeli leader to address a joint session of Congress on March 3 without consulting President Barack Obama first. That disapproval apparently was orchestrated, or at least strongly encouraged, by the White House through comamunications with lawmakers connected to the Congressional Black Caucus. 'I'm not saying the president called anyone personally,' a current White House staffer told Daily Mail Online. 'But yeah, the White House sent a message to some at the CBC that they should suddenly be very upset about the speech.' 'BACK CHANNELS': The Obama administration is nudging black Democrats on Capitol Hill away from attending a March 3 address by ISraeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, a White House aide says . Georgia Rep. John Lewis says he won't attend, but his spokeswoman won't deny that the White House played a part in the decision . Netanyahu addressed a joint session of Congress in May 2011, and he's coming back in March – but Vice President Joe Biden (left) won't be there . The source said it was a 'back-channel' arrangement that did not involve the higher echelons of the West Wing. Butterfield's spokeswoman Kezmiché Atterbury denied it on Friday afternoon, saying he 'was not asked by anyone at the White House or otherwise' to skip Netanyahu's planned address. The North Carolinian is the CBC's chairman. he told the Associated Press that a growing boycott 'is not an organized effort.' But Lewis's spokeswoman Brenda Jones wouldn't deny it after repeated requests. 'I have no comment for you,' she finally said in an email, adding separately that 'my boss does not speak for the CBC.' Jones vented in another email, suggesting that journalists were out to get Rep. Lewis. 'Why are they off on this erroneous quest to make more of something than there is(?)' she wrote. 'Don’t you think the public would benefit from more depth about the Obama-Netanyahu relationship or the dynamics of this snub(?)' And Candace Randle, the CBC's spokeswoman, left open the possibility that the White House could be placing its thumb on the scale. 'I’m unaware of such a request,' Randle said in a brief email, 'and am unable to confirm.' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest declined to provide new information, referring Daily Mail Online to his comments during a reporters' briefing on Thursday. President Obama 'does believe it is up to individual members of Congress to make their own decision about whether or not to attend,' Earnest said then. The White House also said Vice President Joe Biden may not attend Netanyahu's speech, which is expected to focus on Iran's potential to swiftly develop a nuclear weapon. The New York Times all but confirmed on Friday that Biden will be out of town when the prime minister arrives. 'We are not ready to announce details of his trip yet, and normally our office wouldn’t announce this early,' one official told the Times, 'but the planning process has been underway for a while.' Biden's office confirmed on Friday that the vice president expects to be abroad on March 3. No details about his trip have been made available. North Carolina Rep. G.K. Butterfield chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, and says the White House wasn't behind his decision to slip the Israeli PM's speech, but the CBC's spokeswoman sould only say she was 'unaware' of contacts between the organization and the Obama administration . Josh Earnest, the president's chief spokesman, has insisted that Obama thinks congressmen and woman should make up their own mind, a position that now looks shaky . House Speaker John Boehner (right) is taking heat from Democrats for going around the White House and inviting Netanyahu (left) to speak about the global threat of a nuclear-armed Iran . If Biden is absent, it's likely that Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy, the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, would preside along with  Boehner, sitting in the vice president's place – provided he attends. Lewis, a hero of the civil rights movement, said Thursday that the speaker's unilateral invitation to Netanyahu was 'an affront to the president and the State Department' that cannot be ignored. Butterfield, chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said Thursday he was 'very disappointed that the speaker would cause such a ruckus' among members of Congress. He called the speaker's actions 'unprecedented.' Boehner spokesman Michael Steel told Daily Mail Online that 'support for Israel has always been a bipartisan issue, and it always should be.' Butterfield also criticized Netanyahu, saying that by accepting Boehner's invitation without talking to Obama, the prime minister had 'politicized' his visit to the United States."}

The couple knew they had hit something after hearing a ‘horrible squeal’ but when they ran over to see what they had hit, it turned out to be the leopard. ‘The cat in these photographs has been identified tentatively as a leopard,’ Phil Bloom, a spokesperson for the Indiana Department of Natural Resources told WDRB News. ‘Perhaps an immature cat about nine months old.

{"prompt": "One of the oddest aspects of Cyril Smith’s sinister reign in Rochdale was how well-meaning parents came to connive in the abuse of their own children. As whispers of his penchant for doling out corporal punishment spread across the town, he would offer his services to give boys ‘a bloody good hiding’ if they stepped out of line. Parents on Rochdale estates would often use his name to try to frighten badly behaved sons. ‘He was a kind of bogeyman,’ recalls Stephen Moore, a Labour councillor in the Seventies. ‘Parents would say: “If you don’t start behaving, we’ll call for Cyril Smith.” Talking politics: Cyril Smith on the campaign trail . ‘And sometimes they would. Cyril would make his way round, tell the parents he was happy to help, then go upstairs and spank boys till they screamed. He saw it as a kind of public service.’ One such victim was a 16-year-old scooter-riding Mod with a taste for amphetamines and all-night clubbing. He’d spent three months in a detention centre for possession, and relations with his parents were very strained. ‘My dad would scream in my face about how I was causing my mum to worry. The tension was unbearable. ‘Then I came home one night from work and this man was sitting on the settee with my parents on either side of him. He was enormous. Acres of flesh packed into a pinstriped suit. ‘My dad said: “I want you to meet Cyril Smith. He’s the Mayor of Rochdale and is very important. We’ve told him about the problems we’re having and he’s going to have a little chat with you.” ‘My mum and dad left and Smith and I sat staring at each other. “I don’t like your attitude,” he snarled. “Things are going to have to change.” ‘Then he lunged at me, lifted me off my feet, and threw me over his knee. He pulled my trousers and pants down and hammered my flesh with his bare hands like a man possessed. When he’d finished, he dropped me to the floor and stood above me while I lay with my face down trying to forget about the pain. I never made a noise. I wasn’t going to give him the satisfaction of knowing he’d hurt me. Cyril Smith at Buckingham Palace in November 1988. Parents on estates in Rochdale would use his name to scare badly behaved children . ‘My skin was on fire and I could feel the welts forming, but I pulled my trousers up, sat up and stared insolently back at him. “Is that it?” I said. ‘He was still panting but a nasty little smile formed on his face as he knelt next to me and pushed his face close to mine. “Your bad behaviour is going to stop,’ he hissed, “or I’ll kill you.” I thought he was a psycho.’ The teenager hoped he’d seen the last of Smith. He was wrong. When he went back to his job at a local factory, his boss sidled up to his workbench and asked what he was doing at the weekend, adding: ‘I was thinking that maybe we could go camping together in the Lake District.’ When the lad said he’d rather not as camping wasn’t his thing, he suggested they get a caravan instead. The boy said no again. Later that day, his boss called him in and fired him. It was clear this was to be his punishment for having turned down his advances. And worse was to come. ‘You won’t be out of a job,’ he smiled. ‘I’ve seen to that. There’s a friend of mine who runs a spring manufacturing company across town and takes on lads with criminal records. He helps them back on the straight and narrow. ‘I’ve called him and he said he can give you a job at his factory. His name’s Cyril Smith.’ On the boy’s first day there, Smith put his arm around him and said: ‘I’m going to look after you now.’ The boy shuddered. ‘And so began the strangest time I’ve ever known. All week I worked for Cyril, and at weekends he’d be round our house beating the living daylights out of me. ‘I sometimes wondered if it was all a bad dream. I worked for an enormous fat man who’d wink at me all day and tell me he was going to be my dad — then, when the weekend came round, he’d be knocking on our door itching to get my trousers off and start spanking my backside. ‘Cyril tried everything to intimidate me. He told me all the important people he knew. He boasted of his relationship with the chief constable. I wasn’t impressed. ‘I asked him once why he had such a fixation with smacking my backside. Did my parents know he was doing this? He backhanded me and told me I had an attitude problem. ‘After a few months, I think Cyril realised he wasn’t going to win this battle. He wasn’t going to batter me into submission. He got his business partner, Geoff, to sack me. He didn’t have the guts to do it himself. He told my parents I was a lost cause and that there was no hope for me. It was the best day of my life. I got another job soon after and things started to look up. ‘I never told my parents what Cyril had done to me, though I suspect they’d known what was really going on. I was more than relieved to have escaped Cyril’s clutches — but I soon came into contact with boys who hadn’t. ‘Because I’d spent three months in a detention centre, I still had to report to a probation officer, so every few weeks I’d make my way over to their office on Drake Street in Rochdale. ‘That’s where I met other boys who told me that Cyril Smith had seriously sexually abused them. We’d all sit in the corridor waiting to be seen, and the conversation would quickly turn to Cyril. ‘As I listened to their stories, I started to realise I’d got off lightly. These were damaged kids. They had no confidence and came from broken homes. Some had been in care. ‘Most had been in the Cambridge House boys’ hostel that Cyril had opened. That’s where he’d abused them. Their stories sent shivers down my spine. ‘I asked one lad why he’d put up with it. He had nowhere else to go, he said. He couldn’t bear to sleep on the streets. ‘There were other boys I’d bump into in town who told me Cyril had abused them, too. I remember one lad who worked in the cinema as an usher. He had a hollow look in his eyes, as though his future had been ripped out of him. All he had left was a deep sense of loss. ‘I still wonder what happened to those lads. ‘Once I no longer had to meet the probation officer, that world began to recede and I moved on to different things. I worked hard, got married, and ended up going to work in Australia. ‘I returned to Rochdale many years later and no longer thought about Cyril. Then, one day in 1990, the police knocked on my door. They were investigating claims that Cyril Smith had abused young boys. Smith in the Commons. One victim says the MP smacked him after his parents told him he was badly behaved . ‘I had no idea how they’d got hold of me. Perhaps some of the lads who I met at the probation office had mentioned my name. ‘I told them what had happened in the 1960s and made a statement. Cyril was still the town’s MP, and I hoped it wasn’t too late for his past to catch up with him. ‘I never heard anything more from the police, and it wasn’t until his crimes were publicly exposed after his death in 2012 that I realised there had been a number of investigations into Cyril that had gone nowhere. ‘I thought back to what he’d said to me at the time. The threat that he would kill me; the talk of how close he was to the chief constable. I’d laughed it off. But how would other less assured boys have reacted? They’d have been terrified. And that was his aim. Finding vulnerable young boys, striking fear into them and breaking them. ‘I tried to talk to Mum about it, before she got Alzheimer’s. She just shook her head and I could see the tears forming in her eyes. I put my arm round her and didn’t say any more. ‘She knew calling him in was a mistake, but I guess they were at their wits’ end. I didn’t blame them. How could they have known what a real monster he was? ‘But plenty of people did know what a real monster Cyril was. He wasn’t acting on his own. We used to laugh when we saw groups of men getting off the train and coming into Rochdale because we all knew what they were up to. The dirty mac brigade, we called them. ‘Cyril couldn’t have abused all these boys on his own. He had a team of people behind him. They were all in on it. ‘It took the police long enough to knock on my door. I hope there’s still time for Cyril’s cronies to get a knock on their door.’ n Extracted from Smile For The Camera: The Double Life of Cyril Smith by Simon Danczuk and Matthew Baker, published today by Biteback, £16.99. © 2014 Simon Danczuk and Matthew Baker.

{"prompt": "By . Emma Robertson . Electric lights, including those which illuminate laptop computers, smartphones and tablets, often play a key role in causing people to sleep badly, a leading expert has warned. Artificial lights disrupt the body's natural rhythm, affect chemicals in the brain and drive people to use stimulants like caffeine to stay awake longer, according to Harvard academic Professor Charles Czeisler. Writing today in the journal Nature, the professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School called for research to help develop 'behavioural and technical' ways of counteracting the ill effects of artificial light on modern sleeping patterns. Screen breaks: Illuminated screens have been found to affect the body's circadian clock - the genetic mechanism which helps regulate sleep - 'more powerfully than any drug' The decline in the number of hours . slept per night is affecting public health, including a greater risk of . obesity, diabetes, heart disease, depression and stroke in adults and . concentration problems in children, he said. While all electric light affected circadian rhythms - the natural body clock - and sleep, night-time exposure to LED lights like those in phones and computers was 'typically more disruptive' than standard electric light bulbs, he said. 'There are many reasons why people get insufficient sleep in our 24/7 society, from early starts at work or school, or long commutes, to caffeine-rich food and drink,' he wrote. 'But the precipitating factor is an often unappreciated, technological breakthrough: the electric light. 'Without it, few people would use caffeine to stay awake at night. And light affects our circadian rhythms more powerfully than any drug.' Poor sleep has been linked with health problems including obesity, heart disease and depression . Between 1950 and 2000, the average person in the UK increased their use of artificial light sources by four times, with a parallel rise in sleep deficiency, Prof Czeisler said. Artificial light inhibits sleep-promoting neurons in the brain and the nightly release of the hormone melatonin, which aids sleep, while activating neurons that boost alertness, he said. It fools the brain into delaying its 'second wind', which kicked in during the afternoon to see people through to sunset before electric light was invented, until much later in the day. He said that as a result of modern technology 'many people are still checking email, doing homework or watching TV at midnight, with hardly a clue that it is the middle of the solar night'. In a study, 30 per cent of all working adults in the United States and 44 per cent of night workers reported getting less than six hours sleep a night on average. Fifty years ago less than 3 per cent of the US adult population slept so little. And around the world, children are sleeping 1.2 hours less on school nights than a century ago, he said. 'Technology has effectively decoupled us from the natural 24-hour day to which our bodies evolved, driving us to go to bed later,' he said. 'And we use caffeine in the morning to rise as early as we ever did, putting the squeeze on sleep.'"}

{"prompt": "Study found celebrity reinventions are behind women's growing confidence . Women today contrasted with those of the Eighties, who confessed to never reinventing their appearance . By . Rosie Taylor . PUBLISHED: . 08:46 EST, 17 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:20 EST, 17 May 2012 . Celebrities who constantly reinvent themselves have inspired millions of women to dramatically change their appearance, according to new research. High profile queens of reinvention - such as Madonna and Victoria Beckham - have influenced everyday women with an estimated 3.5 million changing their own look after seeing celebrities successfully do the same. And mature masters of reinvention - such as Ann Widdecombe and Esther Rantzen - have inspired older women, who might have previously stuck to a tried-and-tested style, to undergo a complete overhaul of their wardrobes and appearance too. Image overhaul: A sophisticated Victoria Beckham at the Oscars in February 2012, and right, in 2007, with crop, deep tan and push-up bra . Fashion changes at a faster pace these days than ever before, making it easier for women to reinvent themselves. But for today's adventurous women, reinvention means more than trying a new shade of lipstick. Now it involves a complete departure from one look in favour of another. Just as Victoria Beckham changed her blonde crop for brunette bob, and her club-style for ladylike chic, so everyday women are performing such sartorial one-eightys. A total of 2.4 million over 50s will have rebooted their wardrobe ten times before they reach their 60s - ditching the clothes, shoes, make up and accessories associated with certain looks. And it does not just stop at clothes. The study revealed that 3.8m women have radically changed their hair 11 times over the past ten years, experimenting with perms, fringes, bobs and everything in between. A further 2.5 million have dramatically altered their hair colour 12 times in order to reinvent themselves, sporting shades of blonde, black, platinum, grey, red - even purple - in the name of fashion. A study of 1,000 British women for online retailer isme.com found the average British woman experiences an 'eight-year reinvention itch', with 40 per cent of over 50s having changed themselves more in the last ten years than at any other time in their lives. Reasons why women overhaul their image include the desire to escape a fashion rut, cited by nearly one in five of those surveyed, or to be taken seriously int he workplace, a reason cited by one in ten of those surveyed. Queen of reinvention: Over the three decades she has been in the public eye, Madonna has tried every look going, from punk to grunge to ladylike chic . And in the early years: Madonna in the 1985 film Desperately Seeking Susan . However, 73 per cent feel the desire to reinvent themselves comes from fashion being so accessible and immediate nowadays - giving ladies more opportunity to continually change how they look regardless of age. The top celebrity chameleons were Madonna (48 per cent), Victoria Beckham (29 per cent) and Lulu (28 per cent). This Morning agony aunt Denise Robertson also featured on the list (10 per cent). Figures also revealed two-thirds of mature women in the 1980s had never reinvented their appearance for the duration of their adult lives. Harley Street psychologist, Ingrid Collins, said: 'When we look in the mirror, we expect to see a very familiar image, and we have to do this every day.

{"prompt": "Winston Churchill’s unshakeable belief in victory made him one of history’s most celebrated wartime leaders. But a remarkable discovery shows Churchill worried he had pushed his allies too far and feared he had started a war with France. In one of the most controversial decisions ever taken by a Prime Minister, he ordered the bombing of the French fleet in North Africa sending 1,300 French sailors to their deaths. History remembers Sir Winston Churchill for his determination and . unshakeable belief in victory, but a telegram reveals he feared he'd pushed his allies too far . The top secret telegram reveals Churchill's fears Britain could end up at war with France as well as Germany after the Royal Navy bombed . ally's ships. The Prime Minister ordered the attack after France surrendered to . Germany in 1940 . Churchill was worried the Gallic fleet would fall into Hitler’s hands and they could then be used to invade Britain. He gave the French an ultimatum: scuttle the ships or send them across the English Channel. When the French failed to respond he took matters into his own hands and ordered the navy to launch a devastating bombardment of their ships in Mers-el-Kébir in Algeria. The massacre sparked a diplomatic crisis and has been described as the French Pearl Harbour. Many across the Channel have never forgiven him. But while Churchill was widely lauded in the House of Commons for his courage in sending out the message that Britain would fight the Nazis – alone if necessary – a top secret telegram reveals he had his doubts. A copy of which is now going under the hammer reads ‘British Naval forces...asked the French Naval authorities to take certain steps to prevent a number of important French Naval units at this port from falling into German hands undamaged. ‘The French declined to take these steps. Heavy action ensued between British and French Naval forces with great and much regretted loss to the French. HMS Hood, one of the Royal Navy ships involved in the Battle of Mers-el-Kébir . British captain and naval attache in France, Nicolas Butler (R), salutes, in the French city of Brest to commemorate the Battle of Mers-el-Kebir . ‘We cannot tell what the consequences may be, but every precaution should be taken in case the French declare war against us. Further particulars later.’ The telegram was sent by the War Office just hours after the bombing, effectively telling them to prepare for a French declaration of war on Britain. It is believed this message, that is stamped ‘Secret Cipher Telegram’ and is headed ‘Secret’, was for Sir John Dill, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, as there is a red tick next to his name. It is a relative of his who is now selling at International Autograph Auctions in London. The attack on the French came a month after 338,000 British troops were evacuated from Dunkirk and on the eve of the Battle of Britain. General Charles De Gaulle told the French people the bombing was regrettable but rathered the ships and men were killed than they become part of a German force . When Churchill announced the news to the House of Commons he was cheered by all parties as it proved to the world, especially the US, that Britain was still up for the fight. The French responded by launching a demonstration bombing of Gibraltar harbour. The prominent French politician, Pierre Laval, also offered the Germans 500 French pilots for the Battle of Britain which was turned down by Hitler. After the liberation of France in 1944, Laval was arrested, convicted of high treason and executed by firing squad. Some French people understood the reason for the attack and the bereaved family of one sailor killed in it was buried with the French tricolour and the Union Jack. Terry Charman, a historian at the Imperial War Museum, said: “It was an extremely controversial and unnatural thing to do as the French were our allies. 'But we just didn’t trust the word of their admiral who told Britain that rather than let his ships fall into German hands he would scuttle them. 'We couldn’t take the risk of them not doing it and Churchill ordered the attack. Churchill feared the French fleet in Algeria could fall in to Nazi hands . 'It was a calculated risk based Britain thinking the French was so demorilised they wouldn’t do anything. 'There was talk of the French wanting to declare war on us but all they did was a demonstration bombing of Gibralter harbour. 'The newly formed French State cut off diplomatic relations with Britain. 'General de Gaulle, the leader of the Free French in England, made a very dignified statement over the radio to the French people stating that he absolutely regretted what had happened but he rather the ships and men were killed than they become part of a German force. The French 'Pearl Harbour': Battleship Bretagne is struck in battle at Mers El Kebir . Battleship Dunkerque under fire during Operation Catapult otherwise known as the Battle of Mers-el-Kabir . 'Winston Churchill announced the news of the attack in the House of Commons and he was applauded and cheered. 'It sent off signals to the US that Britain was still very determined to carry on the fight.' The telegram is expected to fetch up to £200 when it gos under the hammer at International Auctions next month.

A jailed terrorist who helped to plot an early attack on the World Trade Center has condemned modern jihad and said young men are throwing their lives away by killing innocent people. After being imprisoned for shooting and killing a high-profile rabbi in New York, Egyptian El Sayyid A. Nosair, now 57, went on to help mastermind the 1993 bombing of the Twin Towers from prison. But Nosair, described as 'a star and a hero in the jihad', has attempted to distance himself from radicals behind recent atrocities like last month's Boston Marathon bombings, which claimed three lives and left hundreds wounded. Extremist: El Sayyid A. Nosair, seen left as a young man, confessed to shooting and killing high-profile Rabbi Meir Kahane, seen right in 1985, in a New York hotel in 1990 . He spoke out despite having being convicted of involvement in the 1993 terror attack that killed six people and could have resulted in the loss of thousands of lives. Nosair is thought to have become the first Islamic jihadist to commit murder on American soil when he shot Rabbi Meir Kahane in the ballroom of a New York City hotel in 1990. The father of two, who has remained behind bars ever since, exhibits no remorse over the killing, which he claims was justified because Rabbi Kahane had called for war against Muslims. But Nosair told the Los Angeles Times that by murdering innocent bystanders - as seen in New York, Boston and elsewhere in the years since - extremists did nothing to further their cause. 'There is a difference in the 'passion' that jihadist young men aspire to today and what I was trying to accomplish back in the late '80s and early '90s,' Nosair told the newspaper, adding that he would urge young jihadists to practise restraint. 'Seek help in patience and prayer,' he said. Early attack: Six people were killed and more than 1,000 injured when a truck bomb was detonated in a car park beneath the North Tower in February 1993 . Truck bomb: Port Authority and New York City Police officers are seen inspecting the damage after the explosion in 1993, which left six people dead and over 1,000 injured . Nosair - who is attempting to mount a case to win his freedom - confessed to the murder of Rabbi Kahane to the FBI in 2010, but now claims he was only present at the assassination. He also claims the bombers in the 1993 World Trade Center attack were the masterminds, not him, despite evidence to the contrary. But his new claims - and his remarks on modern jihad - have been dismissed by the team of prosecutors who helped to put Nosair behind bars. Federal prosecutor Andrew C. McCarthy, who said Nosair was a 'star and a hero in the jihad', maintains the 57-year-old will 'never get out'. The very mention of the World Trade Center summons visions of that fateful day in September 2001 when hijacked planes hit the Twin Towers; leaving thousands dead and the western world irrevocably changed. But the Manhattan landmark had been targeted by terrorists eight years before 9/11. On February 26 1993, a truck bomb was detonated beneath the North Tower of the World Trade Center. While the explosion did not bring the towers down as the attackers had planned, it did kill six people and injure more than 1,000. In March 1994, four men were convicted of carrying out the attack; Mahmud Abouhalima, Ahmad Ajaj, Nidal A. Ayyad and Mohammad Salameh. Egyptian El Sayyid A. Nosair was convicted of involvement in the bombing and given a life sentence in 1995. Nosair, who is divorced from his wife and estranged from his two sons, has led prison demonstrations and has threatened fellow inmates to try and force them to convert to Islam. He was initially suspected to have played a role in the September 11 World Trade Center attacks, and has said there may have been 'something I could have done, in my earlier life, to prevent such an occurrence'. Nosair became a U.S. citizen after immigrating from Egypt in 1981, and worked as an engineer in the state courthouse in Manhattan. He targeted Rabbi Kahane at the urging of Omar Abdel Rahman, the blind sheikh who would later be convicted with him on conspiracy charges relating to the 1993 World Trade Center attack. After shooting the rabbi on November 5 1990, Nosair was cleared of murder by a jury in state court but convicted on gun charges. He was sentenced to the maximum 22 years by a judge. His meetings with old cohorts who visited him in jail were monitored by FBI agents, who recorded bomb-making activities underway in Queens. Nosair was sentenced to life with no parole in October 1995 after prosecutors assembled a conspiracy case encompassing the World Trade Center explosion - which killed six people and injured over 1,000 - and federal charges for the murder of Kahane."}

Police chief Sam Dotson has written to the Federal Aviation Administration for approval and hopes to be using drones in the Missouri state capital within the next year. Dotson believes the unmanned devices are a cost effective way to aid his officers, especially with police chases and monitoring large open air events. Citizens in St. Louis might soon have to get used to drones in their skies after the local police chef applied to use the unmanned flying devices . A police chase earlier this week involving a helicopter cost the force $2.5 million, while a police drone would cost between $80,000 and $300,000, depending on features. ‘To help keep officers safe, to help keep the community safe,’ Dotson told KSDK, explaining his reason for requesting drones. ‘For monitoring public space, things like the upcoming Fair St. Louis, baseball games for terrorist, suspicious activity.’ But concerns have been voiced by the American Civil Liberties Union of Eastern Missouri, which says there are too many unanswered questions without local laws in place to protect citizen's privacy. St. Louis Police Chef Sam Dotson says he wants to introduce drones as a money saving way to police chases and events in large open spaces . ‘This is a case where our technology has gotten far ahead of our laws and our ability to protect us from unwarranted government intrusion,’ ACLU executive director Jeffrey Mittman told KSDK. ‘What are we going to do with the information that we gather? Who will have access to it? How will we protect against improper access? How will we protect against hacking of the data?’ Dotson, who is expected to meet with ACLU officials on the matter, said the drones would be used in public spaces where there are already other types of surveillance cameras and so there is no expectation of privacy.

{"prompt": "The pioneering women and men behind the invention of the pill risked being arrested, a new book reveals. The Birth of the Pill, which will be released on Monday, delves into the lives of the four 'crusaders' who brought the pill to fruition - feminist Margaret Sanger, scientist Gregory Pincus, OB-GYN John Rock and philanthropist Katharine McCormick, who funded most of the research. It explains how in the Pill's initial stages in the 1950s, before its approval, Pincus and Rock tested it on 50 unknowing patients in Massachusetts under the guise of a fertility study, so as not to interfere with the state's anti-birth control laws. Scroll down for video . History of birth control: The Birth of the Pill by Jonathan Eig, which will be released on Monday, delves into the lives of the four 'crusaders' who brought the Pill to fruition . The trial was successful - not one of the 50 women ovulated during the experiment - and the Pill went on to be one of the most important discoveries of the 20th century. But the ethically ambiguous way they made this discovery is undeniably a topic of interest. 'You can really have a wonderful ethical discussion and debate about whether it was worth it, whether they were doing things that were beyond the bounds,' author Jonathan Eig told NPR. 'The laws and the ethics of science were very different in the 1950s than they are today - you didn't have to give informed consent, you didn't have to have anybody sign forms giving away their rights, telling them about what these experiments are for. 'So in a way, we do have women being treated like lab animals so that we may find a form of birth control that frees them. There's a great irony there.' The 'pioneers' were also not afraid to cut corners when it came to having the Pill approved and then marketed to women, coming up with a genius way of masking its true purpose. 'They decide, \"We're not going to ask the FDA to approve it as birth control because that will raise a whole bunch of other issues. ... Let's just ask them to approve it for menstrual disorders,\"' explains Mr Eig. So, in 1957, the Pill was sold as Enovid - an FDA-approved treatment of menstrual disorders, with a label on the packaging that read: 'Warning: This pill will likely prevent pregnancy'. 'And it's the greatest advertisement they could ever have,' says Mr Eig, 'because this is what women want.' The book chronicles the history of the birth control pill, from the idea's inception and its controversial inventors to the moment it hit shelves and ignited a sexual revolution. It explains how the group banded together in the Fifties to create a pill that would finally grant women sexual freedom. Teamwork: In the 1950s, Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger (left) and scientist Gregory Pincus (right) collaborated to create a pill that could grant women sexual liberation . When McCormick, a very wealthy early suffragist, and Sanger, who founded Planned Parenthood in the Twenties, first met Pincus in the early Fifties, selling contraception was still illegal in many states. So they had to be careful not to attract too much attention when their research into a contraceptive pill went underway. 'They absolutely could've been imprisoned for some of the work they were doing,' Mr Eig told NPR. Pincus had recently been fired from his job as assistant professor at Harvard for his experimentation with in-vitro fertilization, and he was something of an outcast in the science world. After the women approached him about inventing a 'miracle drug' that could stop ovulation, he became obsessed with the idea. The science was there, but research and experimentation would be expensive; that's where McCormick came in. Contributions: Catholic physician John Rock (left) carried out experiments, and philanthropist Katharine McCormick (right) provided almost all the funds needed for research . A prominent member of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, McCormick had been campaigning for women's rights - including to her own body. According to PBS, at her very first meeting with Pincus, she wrote him a check for $40,000 - the first of many more to come. Indeed, with the inheritance she earned from her husband's death, McCormick funded nearly every dollar that went into making the Pill a reality. The fourth person credited with the 'birth of the pill' in the book is John Rock - a pioneer in sperm freezing and the only Catholic physician to sign a petition to legalize birth control in 1931. Uncovered: The book reveals how the Pill was tested on 50 unknowing patients in Massachusetts under the guise of a fertility study, so as not to interfere with the state's anti-birth control laws . Once the Pill was approved, Rock fought long and hard to convince the Catholic community to accept it. In 1988 the Pope officially condemned the Pill in the encyclical Humanae Vitae, prompting Rock to stop attending mass for the first time in his life. Mr Eig reveals how all four had to disguise the true purpose of their research and experimentation so as to keep naysayers away, which was the only way to make it a reality. 'These guys are like guerrilla warriors - they're always having to figure out ways to do this thing that will attract the least attention,' he explains. 'They can never really say they're testing birth control.' Mr Eig told NPR that he became inspired to write about this topic after he heard a rabbi say in his sermon that the Pill was the most important invention to come out of the 20th century. Skeptical at first, he soon realized it 'had changed more than just science, more than just medicine. It had changed human dynamics. It had changed the way men and women get along in the world.' He continued: 'It changed reproduction, obviously, but it also created all kinds of opportunities for women that weren't there before, it had spread democracy.'"}

{"prompt": "(CNN) -- Of the four to five billion injections given each year in India, at least 2.5 billion are unsafe, according to one study. In some cases, that means they are administered using unsterilized second-hand syringes that could be contaminated with a blood-borne disease such as hepatitis or HIV. A simple change to the way syringes are made could dramatically reduce those figures and save thousand of lives each year, according to David Swann of Huddersfield University, in England. His design for a new kind of syringe that changes color after it has been used was nominated for an INDEX: Award. \"1.3 million people (globally) a year die from unsafe injection practices,\" Swann says, quoting WHO figures. \"It accounts for over 30% of hepatitis A and B cases and 5% of HIV cases.\" He explained that in India it is common for scavengers to hunt through landfill sites looking for old syringes that they can clean up and sell to clinics. \"When you compare a sterile syringe just out of its packaging with a syringe that's been washed, how do you determine the difference?\" he said. \"We conceived an intelligent ink that, if exposed to air by taking it out of the package or if the package is breached that would activate it and turn it red.\" Read this: Tiny computer takes prize at design awards . The ABC Syringe is impregnated with an ink that's sensitive to carbon dioxide and then sealed in a protective atmosphere so that it remains transparent until it is ready for use. After the seal is broken, the shell of the syringe starts to turn a dark red, alerting both doctors to the risk that the syringe may already have been used. Swann's intention is that the introduction of the ABC syringe should be accompanied by a public information campaign so that patients would also associate a red syringe with danger and would be able to insist on sterile equipment. \"We had to be really quite clever in looking at technologies that cost next to nothing, and modified-air packaging is one of those technologies,\" Swann said. \"It only adds 1% to the retail price, so on a two-and-a-half pence (four cents) syringe it becomes quite an interesting proposition.\" According to Swann's calculations, if the ABC syringe is used for 5% of injections administered in India, after five years it will have prevented more than 700,000 infections and saved $130 million in medical costs. Watch this: Life-saving device brings hope to India . Denis Maire, who works for the World Health Organization's health systems and innovation taskforce, said the ABC Syringe could help to make injections safer. \"Anything that can contribute to decrease the reuse of syringes is worth considering and cost is certainly a major factor,\" he said. \"The great advantage of this concept is that not only health care workers but also patients can have a visual appreciation on the safety status of the device. In my view this could be a good deterrent for practitioners to reuse.\" However, he noted that it would be possible for unscrupulous doctors to override the visual warning if their patients did not know the meaning of the color change. He also said that the one-minute delay before the syringe turned red may not be long enough. \"How would you distinguish good and bad syringes if the injections are not practised inside this lap of time?\" he said. \"It could create confusion and render the concept ineffective.\" Ravi Naidoo, a member of the INDEX Award jury and the managing director of Design Indaba, an agency that aims to put creative ideas into practice, said that working with the international medical community would help to turn the prototype into a viable product. \"This innovation speaks to the endless possibilities of design, creativity and innovation in addressing real-world issues,\" he said. \"In addition to being cost-effective, which will ensure the accessibility of the solution, it also allows patients to take charge of a critical issue â€” great example of empowerment through smart design.\""}
{"prompt": "Editor's Note: Sunny Hostin is a legal analyst for CNN and is also a managing director of business intelligence and investigations at Kroll Inc. Previously, Hostin served as an assistant U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C., where she received a Special Achievement Award for her work as a child sex crimes prosecutor. She also served as a trial attorney for the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division. Sunny Hostin says prostitution is not a victimless crime and johns should be charged. (CNN) -- We finally heard from Ashley Dupre -- or \"Kristin\" as former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer knew her. But did we really hear much? I didn't. I wanted to know more about Eliot Spitzer, the man. I wanted to know how the former Sheriff of Wall Street became the Sheriff of Nottingham -- a do-gooder gone bad. A john. \"Client No. 9.\" I wanted to know how he got such a sweetheart deal. How did a ruthless prosecutor get the type of mercy from the government that he rarely, if ever, was willing to give to those he went after? But when Diane Sawyer during her \"20/20\" interview got even close to that topic, Dupre replied, \"legally I've been advised not to discuss that.\" And that makes sense, since she doesn't have an iron-clad immunity deal. If she has nothing in writing, she has to be careful. But what was striking about what I did hear was that Ashley Dupre is no different than the many prostitutes I had met during my time as a prosecutor. Her story, as told to Sawyer and People magazine: Her father left when she was 3; her mother remarried; her older brother, who she described as her best friend, ran away from home when she was 12; she then ran away when she was 17. She became a high school dropout. A life of drugs, alcohol and heavy partying followed. She was raped. Visions of music stardom danced in her head. Music groupie led to high paid \"escort\". But let's call it what it is simply.... prostitution.  Watch Hostin on why Spitzer shouldn't have gotten a pass » . But Spitzer doesn't have to be careful, because he got a pass. A complete pass. He even got to keep his law license, the same one he used relentlessly and mercilessly when he went after wrongdoers. So the question I have is why? Why did the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the very same office that zealously went after Martha Stewart for lying to some of its prosecutors, give him a complete pass, a proverbial get-out-of-jail free card? U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia explained there was no evidence that campaign or public funds were used. Of course there wasn't evidence of that, Mr. Garcia -- Spitzer is rich. The U.S. Attorney also claimed that his office had also determined there was \"insufficient evidence to bring charges against Mr. Spitzer for any offense relating to the withdrawal of funds for, and his payments to, the Emperors Club VIP....\" Really? Since it seems to me (and many other lawyers I have spoken with) that there was evidence that Spitzer violated the Mann Act, which makes it a federal criminal offense to knowingly transport any individual, male or female, across state lines for the purpose of prostitution or sexual activity. The indictment made it clear that Client No. 9 met Kristin, who was based in New York but traveled to Washington, at the Mayflower Hotel, Room 871 to be exact, \"for her tryst.\" It was also alleged that Client No. 9 paid for Kristin's train tickets, cab fare, mini-bar and room service, travel time and hotel. In the way Spitzer paid for her services, it appears that there was also evidence of \"structuring,\" a crime which involves creating a series of financial movements designed to obscure the true purpose of the payments. Prosecutors reportedly had a series of e-mails and wiretapped phone conversations of Spitzer, in addition to financial records. Sounds like good evidence of criminal activity to me. But Garcia finally admitted what was behind his office's decision not to prosecute Spitzer when he said \"[i]n light of the policy of the Department of Justice with respect to prostitution offenses and the longstanding practice of this office, as well as Mr. Spitzer's acceptance of responsibility for his conduct, we have concluded that the public interest would not be further advanced by filing criminal charges in this matter.\" The policy he referred to is that prosecutors don't go after \"johns\" or \"customers\". But why not? What better way to cripple a business than to cut out its customers? Just look at the state of our economy -- when people aren't buying, businesses are in trouble. Pure and simple. Prostitution is not a victimless crime. Look at Ashley, really look at her. She really looks like every other prostitute -- a victim of her upbringing, a victim of her circumstance and now a victim of the government's policy. So there you have it. You can't lie to a federal prosecutor, but if you wire your own money to the accounts of an international prostitution ring, and arrange to have paid sex in the nation's capital, it's all good. You see, Martha. You should have paid for sex in Washington. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sunny Hostin."}

The Prime Minister is expected to travel to the White House this month, his last scheduled encounter with the US President before May’s General Election. Aides said he would raise the plight of Shaker Aamer, who has been held in Guantanamo without charge for almost 13 years. Prime Minister David Cameron (right) will seek to secure the release of the last British resident held in Guantanamo Bay during talks with Barack Obama, sources have revealed. Aides said he would raise the plight of Shaker Aamer, who has been held in Guantanamo without charge for almost 13 years . Mr Aamer, a Saudi citizen, has resident status in the UK, and his British wife and four children, the youngest of whom he has never met, live in South London. Paul Lewis, the Pentagon’s special envoy on Guantanamo, said the US administration was now ‘aggressively pursuing the transfer’ of the controversial detention camp’s remaining inmates. Mr Aamer was cleared for release from the prison by the Bush administration in 2007 and again by President Obama in 2009. The Prime Minister is expected to travel to the White House this month, his last scheduled encounter with the US President Barack Obama before May’s General Election . Paul Lewis, the Pentagon’s special envoy on Guantanamo, said the US administration was now ‘aggressively pursuing the transfer’ of the controversial detention camp’s remaining inmates . He has not faced a trial or been charged with a crime, despite his long detention. He was sent to Guantanamo in 2002 after being picked up in Afghanistan. The US says he was an ally of Osama bin Laden, a claim he denies. Government sources said his case was raised by the Foreign Office with US Secretary of State John Kerry last year, and will be discussed by Mr Cameron and Mr Obama during the Prime Minister’s visit to Washington. ‘We are not expecting immediate release but we will be seeing whether they can look at this case with more urgency,’ said one. US officials say 28 inmates were released last year from the facility in Cuba, the largest number since Mr Obama took office in 2009. The detention centre was opened in the wake of the 9/11 attacks on the US to hold ‘enemy combatants’ in what the US called a war on terror. The US president has pledged to close the controversial prison, but his efforts have been delayed by resistance in the US Congress. Of the remaining 127 inmates at Guantanamo Bay, half have been approved for transfer to other countries. Mr Aamer’s release is understood to have been held up because US authorities have cleared him for release to Saudi Arabia, but not the UK, despite him being resident in this country. British officials, however, are seeking to persuade the US that they can address any concerns about a return to London. Last month, five men held for more than a decade were sent to Kazakhstan for resettlement. The three Yemenis and two Tunisians had been captured in Pakistan and were suspected of having ties to Al Qaeda. US officials said the men, who were also not charged, no longer posed a threat. The human rights organisation Amnesty International has started a petition demanding the release of Mr Aamer, describing his detention without charge as a scandal. UK director Kate Allen said: ‘We need the UK Government to definitively establish what the blockage over his release actually is – this terrible farce has gone on long enough.’ Cori Crider, of the campaign group Reprieve, who is also Mr Aamer’s lawyer, said: ‘Shaker has been cleared for release twice and has a country – and beloved family – ready and waiting for his return. ‘If we are to believe that the US-UK relationship is as special as the Prime Minister claims, he must secure Shaker’s release.’ Mr Cameron has been urged to raise Mr Aamer’s case by MPs from across the political spectrum, while a number of celebrities have backed a campaign to secure his release, including Roger Waters of Pink Floyd and singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor.

{"prompt": "Police have let another home intruder walk free on the grounds he was drunk and high on drugs when he broke in to a disabled man's house at 3.30am. John Pearson was woken by his dog barking and was horrified when he realised a stranger had forced his way into his conservatory. The 59-year-old, who suffers from degenerative disc disease in his spine, chased the younger man out of his semi-detached house and called the police. Anger: Homeowner John Pearson, who is registered disabled, chased the intruder from his home at 3.30am . Alarmingly, the intruder returned minutes later and tried to get back in but was caught by the police who escorted him off the property in Sturminster Newton, Dorset. Mr Pearson said when he called the police . the next day he was shocked to learn they were taking no further action . against the man because he was drunk and was on drugs at the time. It is the second similar case involving . an intruder escaping prosecution on the basis that they were intoxicated at . the time they entered a stranger's house. Mr Pearson, a computer programme engineer, claims he was told by officers the man had mistaken the house for his own. Earlier this week we told how police released another drunk  intruder who had broken into the home of  Tim Ferris, 53 . But it is thought the suspect lives in a village nine miles away, although he is believed to have family living about a mile from Mr Pearson's home in Sturminster Newton. Earlier this week, estate agent Tim Ferris, 53, told of his fury after he trapped a suspected burglar inside his home near Maidstone, Kent, only for the police to later let the man go because he was drunk. On that occasion, Kent police had seemingly accepted the man's explanation that he had drunkenly mistaken Mr Ferris' house for his own. Mr Pearson, who was offered £10 compensation following the break in, said he fears there is a worrying trend of people getting away with minor offences on the basis they are drunk. He said: 'I think people are getting away with things just because they are have been drinking and taking drugs. This is a pattern we are seeing more of. 'If someone was to swear at a police officer they would be arrested but it now seems to me that if you enter someone's property, you get a lift home so long as you have been drinking.' Mr Pearson lives with his wife Lindsey, their 14-month old son and a 15-year-old foster child. He said his intruder, who was aged in his 20s, had damaged a wooden fence to climb into his back garden before using a dog flap to enter the property. Mr Pearson said: 'I came downstairs at about 3.30am when my dog started growling. I was about to go into the kitchen when I saw the man in my conservatory. 'I went out there and started shouting at him and he ran off, so I chased him but couldn't get very far as I'm registered disabled and can't run well. 'I phoned the police and woke up my wife and as I was talking on the phone he reappeared at the back door and tried to get in again, my wife was terrified. Mr Pearson, 59, who was offered £10 compensation, said he was shocked to learn . police were taking no further action against the man because he was . drunk and was on drugs at the time . 'I flew outside and he ran off again and straight into the police. 'But when I spoke to them the next day I was appalled to find out he wasn't going to be charged. 'They said he was on ketamine and alcohol and that he thought my house was his own and didn't know what he was doing. They said it wasn't worth charging him.' Since the incident in February, Mr Pearson has been offered £10 in compensation . from the intruder via the police as part of a 'community resolution' scheme. Mr Pearson refused the gesture. A spokeswoman for Dorset police said: 'We dealt with this incident as criminal damage as the level of crime met the criteria for community resolution. 'The level of crime was not of that to be dealt with through the court. 'Mr Pearson was offered £10 in compensation from the man through the police, and the compensation amount is determined on each individual case. 'An inspector who has dealt with this matter spoke to Mr Pearson very recently and at length. 'He explained to him why the decision was made for a community resolution to the crime and why it was not appropriate to charge the offender. 'Mr Pearson was satisfied with the explanation and did not want to pursue any further complaint.'"}
