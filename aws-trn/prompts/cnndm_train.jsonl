{"prompt": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Michele Trobaugh regrets the day she heard a radio advertisement for Dr. Jan Adams. Beverly Hills plastic surgeon Jan Adams operated on the mother of rapper Kanye West the day before she died. Eager to fix breasts that weren't the same size and a rash that occurred where her breasts rubbed against her stomach, Trobaugh, then 28, went to see Adams in his office in Huntington Beach, California. She says she trusted him right away. \"I fell for his charm. I fell for his confidence,\" she says. But her surgery turned out to be a \"nightmare,\" she says. Trobaugh says that in March 2006, Adams gave her a breast augmentation, tummy tuck and liposuction -- all at one time. \"The next day I woke up fighting for every breath. It was like an elephant was sitting on my chest,\" she says. \"And when I got up to go the restroom I noticed the girdle I was wearing was soaked with fluid and blood. For days I was soaking through blankets and towels.\" Trobaugh says she had three infections. She had a second surgery a few weeks later to remove fluid from her hips. Questions surrounding the death of another of Adams' patients, Donda West, mother of rapper Kanye West, have reignited Trobaugh's pain, she says. She has not sued Adams but says she may in the future. Asked to respond to Trobaugh's comments, Adams issued a statement through his publicist, Kevin Williams. \"I believe very strongly in the fundamental American principle of the right of the individual to defend himself,\" the statement said. \"Recently inaccurate and, frankly, false statements have ciruculated that require clarification. Unfortunately, it has become impossible to separate thsese statements from other professional issues. I will await my turn.\" Today, Trobaugh has advice on how others can avoid becoming plastic surgery victims, and so do board-certified plastic surgeons. Make sure the surgeon is board-certified . This one, say experts, is a no-brainer. For plastic surgery, you want a doctor who's certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery. It's simple: The American Board of Medical Specialties' Web site will tell you if a doctor is board-certified in plastic surgery. Why is it so important to have a board-certified surgeon? Because legally any doctor is permitted to do any procedure -- a psychiatrist could do a breast augmentation. If you use a board-certified plastic surgeon, you know he or she has completed three to five years of training in general surgery and a minimum of two to three years of training in plastic surgery, plus they have to take written and oral tests, according to Dr. Jim Stuzin, chairman-elect of the American Board of Plastic Surgery and assistant clinical professor at the University of Miami. Board-certified plastic surgeons also have to do continuing medical education and take a written test every 10 years. Check the surgeon's record . Trobaugh says she never would have gone to Adams if she'd known he had two malpractice judgments against him. She could have found that out easily by going to the Medical Board of California's Web site. Links to the Web sites of every state's medical board can be found here. Many state licensing boards, like California's, list malpractice judgments, plus any disciplinary actions by the board. (Since Trobaugh's surgery, Adams has had a third malpractice judgment against him, plus an accusation filed with the board). Ask if the surgeon has hospital privileges . Even if you're having a plastic surgery procedure at an outpatient clinic, it's worth asking where the doctor has hospital privileges, because hospitals do background checks, says Dr. Rod Rohrich, past president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. \"If they don't have hospital privileges, that's a huge red flag,\" he says. Come armed with questions for the doctor . One crucial question for your potential surgeon is how often he or she does the procedure you're interested in. \"If I'm coming to you for a facelift, you'd better do it almost weekly,\" says Rohrich, who's also chairman of the department of plastic surgery at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. The Arizona Medical Board's Web site has a list of questions you can print out and bring with you to the doctor's office. For example, the medical board suggests asking whether the physician will be performing the procedure in its entirety. Be wary of multiple procedures . Trobaugh says when she went to Adams, he suggested three procedures. \"When you bundle procedures, the risk goes up,\" says Stuzin, the plastic surgeon in Miami. The more procedures you have, the more money the doctor makes. Dr. Grant Carlson, a plastic surgeon at Emory University School of Medicine, says an unethical surgeon might suggest a neck lift when someone has come in looking for just for a nose job. \"Unfortunately, money is a motivation in some people.\" Perhaps the most valuable advice, Trobaugh says, is to be swayed only by objective information about the surgeon, and not by how the doctor makes you feel. \"[Adams] truly sounded like he was going to help me. He seemed like he would be truly concerned about me,\" she says. But Trobaugh says that when things didn't go well after her surgery, she was taken aback by Adams' response. \"I told him, 'I can't put my right arm down -- there's a huge lump under my arm.' I was crying,\" she says. She says he told her to take her medicine and rest and give herself time to heal. More than a year and a half after her surgery, Trobaugh says her stomach is \"concave,\" she has shooting pains in her breasts, and her \"nipples are uneven and in the wrong place.\" Trobaugh says she wishes she had taken a friend or relative with her to her pre-surgical appointments with Adams. \"An aunt or my mother or some other strong female in my life might have picked up on things I didn't pick up on, or thought of questions I didn't think of,\" she says. \"And there are no stupid questions when you're about to alter yourself in some major way.\" E-mail to a friend .

{"prompt": "(CNN) -- Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said he will pursue a full United Nations membership bid during a speech Friday that was likely meant to both make the case for membership and manage domestic expectations. \"We are going to the United Nations to attain full membership\" from the U.N. Security Council, Abbas told an audience in Ramallah, tempering his rhetoric by adding that \"we are not going to bring independence. Let's not exaggerate. \"We will continue to negotiate,\" he said. Abbas says he wants the Palestinian territories \"to be represented in its natural borders,\" calling disputed territories inhabited by Israeli settlers \"illegal.\" \"We want a seat at the United Nations, and we don't want anything more,\" Abbas said. He says Palestinian leadership does not seek to \"isolate the state of Israel, but rather isolate the policies of Israel,\" saying he will head to the United Nations headquarters in New York \"carrying an olive branch with us.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is also expected to speak next Friday at the United Nations, has said the move could complicate the peace process and further destabilize the region. \"We have been calling all along for the Palestinians to return to negotiations,\" said Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev. Regev called the issue of settlements \"a red herring\" that he says Palestinian leaders have used to avoid talks with Israel, deciding to grandstand on the international stage instead of re-engaging in peace negotiations. Hamas, the Palestinian organization that holds sway in Gaza, also was critical of Abbas on Friday, saying he is showing a willingness to negotiate and acknowledgement of Israel, which would \"deprive the Palestinian people from their right to come back to their homeland.\" \"We are warning him not to go,\" said senior Hamas official Mahmoud al-Zahar. \"This is going to make more division inside the Palestinian people.\" As regional pressure mounts over the prospective bid next week, U.S. diplomats have been scrambling to head off the burgeoning controversy, though some analysts suggest the decision to take the vote to the Security Council could reflect a political posturing by the Palestinian leader. Abbas concluded his speech Friday by acknowledging \"other options,\" presumably referring to his government's ability to weigh a host of decisions at the U.N. General Assembly next week, which may or may not include the full membership bid. \"As for the other options, we have not taken a decision,\" he said. While the United States has vowed to veto a full membership application, should it actually come before the U.N. Security Council next Friday, the Palestinian government could also go to the General Assembly, where only a majority vote would be needed to gain a lesser status, that of a permanent observer state, similar to the position that the Vatican currently holds. A vote in its favor would be all but assured. The Palestinians currently hold the status of a permanent observer entity. As an observer, the delegation can speak in the General Assembly but not vote. A successful vote in either body will not lead to an established \"state\" with defined borders, but would afford the Palestinian government an upgraded international status allowing them to pursue legal actions against Israel. Abbas is expected to personally submit the request for full membership. CNN's Kevin Flower contributed to this report."}

A Greek journalist put on trial for publishing the names of more than 2,000 tax cheats was sensationally acquitted last night. Costas Vaxevanis was told he was a free man by an Athens court in a case which has created international  concern over press freedom. The 46-year-old had been accused of violating privacy laws by publishing the details of wealthy compatriots who have HSBC bank accounts in Switzerland. He faced up to two years in jail if convicted.

Mr Vaxevanis (left) had been accused of violating privacy laws by publishing the details of wealthy compatriots who have HSBC bank accounts in Switzerland. Above, he was led away by police following his arrest last week . Commenting on the trial before his acquittal yesterday, Vaxevanis, editor of Hot Doc magazine, told reporters: 'Obviously there are political motives'. Pictured outside the prosecutor's office in Athens . Commenting on the trial before his acquittal yesterday, Mr  Vaxevanis told reporters: ‘There are political motives. You see most of the names on the list are friends of the political system.’ He also claimed his prosecution was ‘targeted and vengeful’, adding: ‘There isn’t the slightest evidence to support the charges.’ But after just one day, he was sensationally acquitted – although no reason was given. ‘The court has ruled that you are innocent,’ Judge Malia Volika said. The  journalist told supporters afterwards: ‘This decision allows journalists to do their job.’ The list has been dubbed the 'Lagarde List' after Christine Lagarde (above), head of the IMF, who was the French finance minister when it was passed to Greek authorities . At a time of unprecedented  austerity in Greece, his exposure of allegations involving £1.6billion took on huge significance. Many Greeks believe tax evasion is undermining a struggle to cut public costs and raise revenue under an EU/International Monetary Fund bailout deal. Mr Vaxevanis, who edits the  magazine Hot Doc, was arrested on  Sunday after he published the list. He has always insisted that he acted in the public interest. Before yesterday’s acquittal, his supporters had packed the courtroom as Mr Vaxevanis’s lawyers began their defence. They questioned why the prosecution had charged him, despite no one on the list filing a complaint about privacy violation, a rare occurrence in a freedom of speech or defamation case in Greece. Marek Marczynski, of Amnesty International, said: ‘It is deeply troubling that Vaxevanis was facing criminal charges, and possibly jail time, for disclosing information in the public interest. ‘This step increases the risk that other journalists will censor themselves and refrain from legitimate criticism of the government to avoid prosecution. ‘This chilling effect would seriously undermine freedom of expression – a central purpose of which is to foster informed public debate about the functioning of government. ‘The authorities must clearly demonstrate why this severe sanction was necessary and proportionate. The right to privacy should not be used to silence criticism of the government.’ The 2,059 Greeks named on the list, who have a combined £1.6billion in Swiss accounts, include dozens of prominent business figures and two former ministers. Above, Vaxevanis talks to the press . The document at the centre of the case has been nicknamed the ‘Lagarde list’ after Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF. She was the French finance minister when it was handed to the Greek government by France over two years ago. Mr Vaxevanis has said an anonymous source gave him a copy because ministers had done nothing with it. The 2,059 Greeks named on the list, who have a combined £1.6billion in Swiss accounts, include dozens of prominent business figures and two former ministers. Mr Vaxevanis’s supporters included the Greek daily newspaper Ta Nea, which also published the list over 11 news pages. It made clear there was no evidence any of those named had broken tax evasion laws. Riot police are engulfed in flame by a petrol bomb thrown by protesters earlier this month. Greek trade unions called a 24-hour general strike to oppose new austerity measures just last week . Greece has so far failed to convict any big names of tax evasion, further alienating voters. Prime minister Antonis Samaras’s government has not commented on the accuracy of the list, although two former finance ministers have acknowledged they had copies of the document. A former Greek minister whose name appeared on a list of tax  evaders has committed suicide. Friends of Leonidas Tzanis, who  hanged himself at his home, claimed the 57-year-old had said he could no longer bear the humiliation of being publicly accused. His brother Mihalis, 67, a retired taxi driver, said: ‘He was a self-made man. He was very sensitive and the list really affected him.’ VIDEO: Journalist Costas Vaxevanis is acquitted ."}

Unrepentant: Elliot Jackson went on Facebook to say he 'wished' Cregan would come to Wales and 'take out our pigs' A man has been arrested for allegedly setting up a Facebook site praising murder suspect Dale Cregan. Detectives took jobless Neil Swinburne, 22, away for questioning after they traced the website ‘Dale Cregan is a Hero’ to his home in Liverpool. The page contained posts which mocked the deaths of WPCs Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes. One read: ‘So a pair of coppers got killed who gives a s***?’ Another, making reference to the Hillsborough report which criticised the police for the disaster in which 96 fans died, added: ‘Justice for the 96 not the two.’ Swinburne was arrested under the Communications Act 2003. If found guilty, he faces a six month jail sentence. He was bailed last night. Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan, of Greater Manchester Police, said: ‘I think [the public] would have wanted us to take positive action and that’s exactly what ourselves and Merseyside Police have done.’ Elsewhere, an internet troll who described Cregan as a ‘legend’ stood by his comments, comparing the murder suspect to crazed killer Raoul Moat. Jobless Elliot Jackson of Newtown, Powys, went on Facebook to say he ‘wished’ Cregan would come to Wales and ‘take out our pigs’. When confronted by the Mail, the 20-year-old said he had no sympathy for the two WPCs because police officers are ‘all dirty scumbags’. Speaking about Cregan, he added: ‘He is a legend. He shot down two police. Move over Raoul Moat, there’s a new guy on the block.’ Jackson, who admits he has been to jail for violent crimes, initially demanded money for an interview, but spoke even though he was assured he would not receive a penny.

{"prompt": "(Mashable)  -- YouTube has officially launched its new TrueView ad format, allowing site visitors to avoid watching ads they're not interested in. Users will now be able to look for a countdown button that will let them skip an ad after it plays for five seconds. In some cases, viewers will be able to select which ad to watch out of three pre-roll options. As we reported back in June, YouTube had been experimenting with the button -- allowing users to stop ads from playing -- for awhile. The other option, allowing users to select which ad to watch, is similar to the one offered on Hulu, where long-form video content has typically had a stronger presence. It looks like some advertisers are reacting positively to the new ad format. Some have said TrueView is a cost-effective advertising option that provides them with a better ability to target their audience. \"Thus far, we've seen about a 40 percent view-through rate and since we only pay when potential customers actually watch a video, we have more control over our budget,\" said Lee Topar, director of online marketing for GoPro, in a statement to Google's Inside AdWords blog. TrueView, which is presently only available to advertisers with managed accounts, isn't all that widespread on YouTube just yet.

{"prompt": "(CNN) -- In the midst of the contentious debate over the Common Core State Standards, many critics have lost perspective on its purpose. Why did so many governors, educators and policymakers across both parties join together to create the standards in the first place? A brief look at Common Core's history would help explain its significance and counter some of the criticisms. In 1983, then Secretary of Education Terrel Bell commissioned the seminal report, \"A Nation at Risk,\" which highlighted American students' falling SAT scores and awakened the nation to its educational malaise. Among many of the report's recommendations, which eventually became a platform for modern education reforms, were calls for \"more rigorous and measurable standards.\" American students were victims of low expectations and inconsistent learning goals. But despite the report's warnings and billions of dollars more spent on education, not much has changed. Thanks to benchmarked national and international exams, like the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) or Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), we know that American students continue to fall short. (There's one sliver of good news: For a number of reasons there have been dramatic improvements in some individual states like Massachusetts.) These exams highlighted how the performance of American students differed widely between states and districts. Some states had high internationally competitive standards; others were far too low. In fact, some states were dumbing down standards and exams in order to hide the poor performance of their students. For example, New York State rated 87% of its fourth graders proficient in math, according to its own state testing in 2009. That would be astounding -- if true. But NAEP results calculated that only 40% of the state's fourth graders were proficient or better in math. Educational performance in many districts and states resembled Lake Wobegon -- the fictional place in Garrison Keillor's \"A Prairie Home Companion\" where \"all the women are strong, all the men are good looking, and all the children are above average.\" But reality is different. Local control has always been an essential right of education in America, but there was a growing problem: When different states with different standards and different tests proliferated, we ended up with unreliable measures of how our children are really doing. A wide and disparate variety of education standards promotes chaos and deception. Realizing this, in 2009, a collaborative involving the National Governors Association and Council of Chief State School Officers began to discuss the need for common standards and accountability. The end goal is that an \"A\" in math in New Jersey should be equivalent to an \"A\" in math in Louisiana, or in California, and so on. So began the coordinated effort from governors, educators and legislators to compose benchmarked standards that would be the same across state lines. The product became the Common Core State Standards. Its genesis was local and its purpose was to lift education performance through state, not federal, collaboration. This was the original intent of the Common Core. It is a worthy and necessary idea. Unfortunately, outside forces have interfered with or distorted the idea, obscuring its real merits. Federal intrusions such as the Race to the Top grants have not been helpful. Common Core isn't without its problems, but some of have been exaggerated and some have been made up out of thin air. We can't lose sight of the original intent. Should Common Core fail, the movement -- decades in the making -- toward rigorous, common standards would be dealt a serious blow. While various questions about Common Core and its implementation persist, such as how to handle data privacy or concerns that some of the standards may not be rigorous enough, individual states have the right and ability to craft their own supplemental solutions. For example, this year Ohio passed HB 487 to protect the confidentiality of student data and Florida altered its Common Core standards to include more advanced calculus standards. Some of the criticisms leveled against Common Core stem from mistakes made in local implementations -- not from a uniform federal mandate. It is ironic that the very thing which many of Common Core's critics value the most -- local control -- has often resulted in curricula, subject matter, readings, and exercises in local classrooms that are objectionable, substandard, or politically tendentious. If Common Core fails, education reform will regress and American students' flat or falling test results in learning will continue. It must be noted that many of Common Core's critics still lack a persuasive alternative or any alternative at all."}
{"prompt": "(CNN) -- As far as I'm concerned, John Matuszak said everything there is to say about professional football back in 1979 when he was playing the role of a bent lineman in \"North Dallas Forty.\" Matuszak, or \"Tooz\" as players and fans knew him, was something of a renegade individualist in the National Football League and the movie's script gave him the opportunity to unleash a rebel yell: Embittered by his team's tough loss, and by an assistant coach's lame scolding, his character goes off on the coach, shouting at one point, \"Every time I call it a game, you call it a business. Every time I call it a business, you call it a game.\" And it's that very dichotomy that looms even larger during Super Bowl week. The media keep insisting there's a game being played Sunday night in New Jersey. But all anybody really cares about is the Business -- as in, the torrents of revenue being raked in from advertising (have you seen that there are now trailers---for the commercials?), the marketing, the gambling and, of course, the partying that goes on not only in New York and New Jersey in the lead-up to the Ultimate Game, but from sea to shining sea Sunday night. Players know it, for sureâ€”and it continues to embody my own ambivalence about American tackle football. I get caught up in the game's drama, its unexpected twists, its ongoing tension between best-laid game plans and the ever-looming potential for their disruptions. I get caught up, too, with the sideline rants, growls, collisions and screw-ups caught at varied speeds by the wizardry of NFL Films. But while football's orchestrated aggression and violence may entertain me, my family and friends--and the rest of Living Room Americaâ€”we're all newly alive to the physical and mental risks these players are taking. How does one stay passionate about football in the face of the grim, steadily mounting number of cases involving ex-players undergoing physical and mental injury and anguish over the sport's long-term effects? In last Sunday's New York Times Magazine, author Steve Almond wondered whether it was immoral to watch and enjoy the Super Bowl while knowing full well that playing the game has caused \"catastrophic brain injury ... not as a rare and unintended consequence, but as a routine byproduct of how the game is played.\" I've expressed similar misgivings here about the flood of disclosures about long-term injury and the manner in which the NFL tried at first to either disregard or demean this peril. It's not just the dementia, memory loss and other symptoms that cast shadows over the NFL's gaudy, golden image. This seems the right place to mention that Matuszak, who was so physically imposing as a player that he seemed invincible, died 10 years after \"North Dallas Forty\" was made. He was only 39 years old and his death was attributed to an overdose of prescription pain medication. Gregg Easterbrook, who publishes the weekly Tuesday Morning Quarterback column for ESPN.com, wrote this week that painkiller abuse \"may be pro football's next scandal.\" Over time, watching these players run into each other at top speed while imagining what their minds and lives will be like 20 years afterward could finish me off as a fan. So could the sheer fatigue of witnessing, year after year, the NFL's seemingly inexhaustible capacity for inhaling money, which only compounds its overbearing corporate culture. I already have little patience with the game's ethos as articulated in such bromides as \"Doing Whatever It Takes to Win\" or that deathless line that the late, exalted Green Bay coach Vince Lombardi appropriated from a John Wayne movie, \"Winning isn't everything, but it's the only thing,\" which even Lombardi, the man for whom the Super Bowl Trophy is named, came to believe was too simplistic. Such platitudes have made tackle football a useable, if not overused metaphor for what it's like to work, live and, above all, prevail in modern corporate society. But it's not just a metaphor. Hard-working men such as my father found release, empathy and satisfaction watching the comparably hard work of his beloved New York Giants for decades. It used to be enough for he and millions of fans over the decades of professional football history to watch skilled craftsmen ply their trade, defy the odds, impose their wills, share their joy and passion. It'd be nice, too, if somewhere in the hype and hysteria, we could all calm down enough to see the Super Bowl in such elemental terms. But as near as I can tell, it's the Business that now holds an overpowering edge over the Game. And what's worse: I can't tell how much longer the Game itself will hold out. opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gene Seymour."}
{"prompt": "Lisa-Jayne Samuels has been jailed for perverting the course of justice after she accused a man she barely knew of raping her - putting him through a year of hell . A mother-of-four has been jailed after she put a man through a year of hell by making up claims he had raped her. Lisa-Jayne Samuels, 29, invented the allegation because she wanted her mother to feel sorry for her, a court heard. She even had police draw up an e-fit to back up the bogus claims and picked a man, Terry Brown, out in an ID parade. Her allegation hung over Mr Brown for more than a year before she finally admitted she had made up her claim that he spiked her drink and attacked her. During that time he was attacked by a gang and his pregnant partner lost her baby, the court heard. Samuels' own lawyer described her actions as 'loathsome' when she was sentenced at Basildon Crown Court, Essex. She pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice and was jailed for 20 months. Samuels, of Southend, Essex, called 999 at 1am on October 10, 2012, claiming to have been raped at the town's cliffs. When interviewed, she gave a detailed description of her attacker, claiming she had been drinking with friends at the Last Post in Southend, where she met a man she knew from a night shelter who spiked her drink and attacked her. An e-fit was drawn up and Mr Brown, of Basildon, Essex, was arrested the following year. But he was later released without charge after police uncovered inconsistencies in Samuels's story. CCTV from the Last Post and a nearby off-licence showed no sign of Samuels at the time she claimed to be there, and the friends she claimed she was with on the evening were found not to exist. During a voluntary interview with Samuels on December 6, 2013, she eventually admitted to making up the whole story. She said she had lied to try and reconcile with her mother. It is understood she had seen Mr Brown, who hardly knew her, on the night she claimed she had been attacked and based the details of her fictitious attacker on him. Samuels has a history of making such claims. In 2002, she made false claims to police, but later admitted it was so her mother would not find out she had slept with a Kosovan man. In the same year, she phoned police saying she had been raped in a public toilet and also made a hoax fire call to 999. The court heard Samuels, who had made false claims in the past, invented the allegation because she wanted her mother to feel sorry for her . Sentencing Samuels, Recorder Anthony Abell said: 'Rape is one of the most serious and repulsive crimes there is. 'A false allegation of rape can have dreadful consequences on the innocent person who has committed no crime whatsoever. 'It seems your initial call to the police was an impulsive act but you persisted in it, you made an e-fit and identified your supposed attacker in a line up - that was not impulsive. I have a duty to the public, meaning your sentence must be immediate and must be of some length. ' Samuels  has struggled with addiction to alcohol and problems with drugs, including crack cocaine. Her defence solicitor, Paul Vickers, tried to argue her sentence should be suspended, but he was unsuccessful. He said: 'She accepts what she has done was loathsome and describes her actions as stupid. 'You are dealing with a lady who was homeless, intoxicated and in the grip of an addiction, who botched a scheme to enable her to get the support of her mother, to try to get her to feel sorry for her and to take her back and to rebuild her relationship with her. ' Samuels claimed she been attacked after drinking in the Last Post pub in Southend, but it later emerged she was not there at the time she claimed she had been ."}
{"prompt": "Marion Bartoli's first match back on British grass since winning Wimbledon ended in retirement and defeat to a 15-year-old schoolgirl from Surrey. It could not have been more different from the day almost a year ago when she stood on Centre Court holding the Venus Rosewater Dish having achieved her life's dream. The Frenchwoman retired a month later but accepted an invitation to play in the exhibition Liverpool Hope University International Tennis Tournament at Liverpool Cricket Club. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Bartoli announce retirement six weeks after winning Wimbledon . Off her game: Marion Bartoli plays a shot before she was forced to retire from the Liverpool International . A dream come true: British teenage Jodie Burrage celebrates as she beats the Wimbledon champion . Her first opponent was teenager Jodie Burrage, and it quickly became clear when Bartoli said she had not played much tennis, she really meant it. The 29-year-old had been cautious about her hopes beforehand, saying: 'Now I can kind of accept to miss a tennis ball. 'I just still love to play. My body couldn't take the amount of training and what I still had to do to be a professional tennis player, but to be a recreational tennis player is something I can probably do still. 'If she beats me that's fine. It's not like I need to win any more.' Bartoli was virtually unrecognisable from the player who did not drop a set at Wimbledon last year and the disbelief on Burrage's face was clear as she raced into a 4-0 lead. Bartoli won the next four games but could not save the set, and trailing 7-5, 3-2 she pulled out with a right shoulder problem. Rusty: Frenchwoman Bartoli has played little tennis since she retired in August last year . Burrage was left to celebrate the most unlikely of wins, saying: 'I can't believe it. It's amazing to be able to say that, and even to be able to play against her. So to win, it's unreal. 'I was really nervous, I was thinking, 'Just get a couple of games', or even a game. Then when I was out on the court, I couldn't believe the scoreline and how I was playing. I played really well. 'When I won the first game, I thought it was lucky. When I went 4-0 up, I was like, 'Oh my God, you could get a set'. I didn't think I'd win. Then I think I lost my focus a bit but I still managed to get that and then go up in the second. 'Unfortunately she had to pull out, but still it was incredible. When I told my friends from tennis I was playing her, they were telling me I should be really excited not nervous. They're going to be really happy for me.' Serving it up: Bartoli (left) was taking on Burrage in her first match at the exhibition event in Liverpool . Burrage, 208th in the junior world rankings, earned the chance to play in the event by winning a junior tournament in Liverpool last year. That gave her a pass into qualifying, which she came through on Sunday, but her first opponent came as a big shock. 'I don't think we knew Bartoli was playing but then after I won qualifying I was told, \"You're playing Bartoli on Thursday\",' Burrage said. 'I just said, \"What? Excuse me?\". Hug: Bartoli gives a ball boy a cuddle before being forced to retire with a shoulder injury . 'I've just played girls round my age before, I haven't played any professionals like her.

{"prompt": "(CNN) -- A member of American Front, a white supremacist group, has pleaded guilty in Florida to one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and will serve three years in prison, prosecutors said. Christopher Brooks, 27, was one of 14 people charged this year in connection to an investigation into the group. In exchange for his plea, prosecutors dropped two other felony counts -- participating in paramilitary training and conspiracy to shoot into an occupied dwelling -- according to Osceola County State Attorney's Office spokesman Bernie Presha. Brooks, who pleaded guilty Wednesday, is the first of the 14 to resolve his case. The alleged ringleader of the group, Marcus Faella, is scheduled to go on trial this month. According to police, Faella was planning to stage provocative disruptions at Orlando City Hall and at a Melbourne, Florida, anarchist gathering that included members of anti-racist skinhead groups. Faella, police documents say, wanted to stir up media attention to help gain new recruits for American Front, which hate-tracking groups says has been faltering since the death of its leader, David Lynch, in California. The 25-year-old group enjoyed a resurgence in 2007 under Lynch, described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a charismatic leader who helped form it in 1987. But Lynch was shot to death in his home in March 2011, leaving the group with no clear leader, according to the Anti-Defamation League. Most of the group's 50 or so members appear to live in Florida, according to the ADL. \"Faella views himself and the other members of the AF as the protectors of the white race,\" investigators wrote in an affidavit, referring to the group by its initials. \"Faella has stated his intent during the race war is to kill Jews, immigrants and other minorities.\" According to police, Faella's group watched videos training them in fighting and the use of AK-47s and other weapons at a compound in Saint Cloud, Florida, which the affidavit said is ringed with barbed wire and protected by pit bulls and firing positions facing the driveway. The property was meant to become a refuge for white supremacists after the fall of the U.S. government during a race war, investigators wrote. The group was allegedly making body armor and sniper suits and stocking up on supplies in preparation. The charges came on the heels of a two-year investigation based on the reports of a confidential informant who had to flee the fortified compound after Faella nearly discovered secret recordings the informant had made of training exercises, according to the arrest affidavit.

{"prompt": "(CNN) -- Starting next year, Cubans traveling abroad will face fewer hurdles leaving the country. The official news site Granma reported Tuesday that the Cuban government will no longer require a travel permit and a letter of invitation. Until now, Cubans had to pay $150 for an exit visa. A resident in the country that the Cuban wanted to visit would also have to write a letter of invitation. Read more: Raft with Cuban refugees sinks near Cancun .

Medical professionals are only allowed to leave Cuba to work for the government abroad.

What other conclusion could any human being with a heart draw from the video in which a little cat bravely and boldly saves a boy being attacked by a dog? Sure, dog people will try to argue otherwise. They'll point to pugs and sheepdogs and Shih Tzus and other examples of cuddly, loyal, nonviolent pups. But when's the last time you heard of a kid being viciously mauled by a tabby? I'm not saying all dogs are evil. But cats certainly don't get the credit they deserve. Think popular culture, the heroic dogs immortalized in our stories. There's Lassie. Benji. Rin Tin Tin. Old Yeller. Toto. Should we count White Fang? Anyway, can you think of a single famous fake cat hero besides Puss in Boots? And in real life, dogs get plenty of good press. Man's best friend and all of that. Cats are denigrated, treated as less than, relegated to old women and semi-ironic decorations on sweatshirts. Grumpy Cat. Or nasty and creepy, like Mr. Bigglesworth. Or the Siamese cats in \"Lady and the Tramp\" -- you know, the movie with the heroic dog couple. Or stupid, like Sylvester. \"Dog lover\" is a compliment. \"Cat lady\" is not. How refreshing to see not just another cat-in-a-cardboard-box video (though I love them, too) but a cat doing something, being brave, saving the day. Tara, the little cat in this video, isn't just a hero to that one child. Tara is a hero to cats and cat lovers everywhere, tired of being upstaged by the bigger, brawnier, droolier pets who can't even manage to use a litter box. Let's hope Tara inspires a generation of cat heroes around the globe -- as well as the rest of us, including those in children's literature and Hollywood -- so we no longer see cats just as lazy, fat Garfield-style layabouts, but ferocious, fierce daredevils. Move over, Superman. Tara, the movie, is coming to a theater near you soon. Cats love nothing more than to bask in the sun, literally. Maybe now it's time for cats to have their metaphorical moment in the sun as well. Go Tara!"}
{"prompt": "If Andy Robinson had led Scotland to victory over Tonga two years ago, it’s possible that Vern Cotter would still be enjoying French cuisine rather than being introduced to the culinary delights of a Killie pie. It was the defeat at the hands of the South Sea Islanders at Pittodrie that led to the Englishman’s resignation — and opened the door, eventually, for the Cotter era. Delayed for a year after the SRU refused to buy out the final 12 months of his contract at Clermont Auvergne, the change has been worth waiting for if the Kiwi’s first six matches in charge are anything to go by. Vern Cotter prepares his Scotland players for their Autumn international against Tonga . Scotland look a team reborn and go into the match against Tonga at Rugby Park looking to make it five wins out of seven under Cotter, the only defeats coming against the top two sides in world rugby, New Zealand and South Africa. The head coach’s time in charge has led to a change in fortunes of not just the team but also of back-row forward Johnnie Beattie, who had never been a Robinson favourite. In fact, the former Glasgow star was so far out of the picture under him, he didn’t even make the 60-strong training squad put together for the three defeats to New Zealand, South Africa and Tonga in 2012 that eventually led to his resignation. Beattie holds no ill-will against Robinson, but if he had still been in charge, perhaps the 29-year-old would have been on club duty for Castres this weekend rather taking the field at No 8 for his country. The focus is the future, however, not what might have been, and Beattie knows how tough it will be to win a regular starting place in a Scotland team playing what he believes is the best, most exciting rugby he has seen since he made his debut against Romania in 2006. Back-row forward Johnnie Beattie has been given a new lease of life under Cotter's regime . The way Cotter, not the most demonstrative of men, has gone about his business since he took over last summer, has convinced him the national team is going places. ‘There is no selling of the sizzle with him,’ said Beattie. ‘There is no razzmatazz and falseness. ‘He is just a good old-fashioned bloke, who is a good rugby coach. Already we can see after two games of the Autumn Tests his imprint, his game plan, his structures and how he wants us to go about our play. We are definitely in a better place under him. ‘Overall, he has made minor adjustments and has changed the basic structures of our play. How we get into phase play, how we keep the ball, how we stretch defences. All those things, those simple things, he has come in and implemented in a better way. ‘It is quite clear he has made a massive difference, especially when you realise this is mainly the same group of players, with a few youngsters coming in, that he is working with compared to coaches before.’ Scotland players line up as they look to make it fives wins out of seven under Cotter . Beattie, who celebrated his 29th birthday on Friday, believes the Scotland fans are also buying into the Cotter era, with the atmosphere against New Zealand the best he had ever experienced at BT Murrayfield. ‘The rugby we are producing is making it more of a spectacle for our supporters and we saw that from the support we got against New Zealand,’ he continued. ‘We did not win, granted, but the effort, our ability to retain the ball, the ability to stretch teams, meant we gave the supporters something to shout about. I have not seen that level of support pretty much since I have been involved. ‘That game against New Zealand was the first time I have been back at Murrayfield since we lost to England in the Six Nations nine months ago, when we got humped 20-0. Scotland showed their recent improvement, despite losing to New Zealand at Murrayfield . ‘We showed absolutely nothing and produced absolutely nothing and could not create anything for our fans to get behind us for or to enjoy. In that space of time, to go where we have been to where we are now is great and very encouraging, but the important thing is we keep working and keep getting better.’ The competition for the No 8 jersey is fierce. South African Josh Strauss will be eligible to play for Scotland through residency in time for the 2015 World Cup and with Adam Ashe, David Denton and Ryan Wilson also in contention, the match on the artificial surface at Rugby Park is a vital one for Beattie. He wasn’t picked for the 2011 World Cup in New Zealand and is determined not let the showpiece occasion in England next year pass him by. Beattie missed out on the last World Cup but is determined not to let England 2015 pass him by . ‘I would love to be involved in the World Cup but rugby is a funny old game and you never know what is going to happen,’ said Beattie. ‘In the life of a professional rugby player, you see injuries all the time, players in and out, coaches change their views on you. ‘I didn’t make Andy Robinson’s squad two years ago and I know things can change very quickly, so I am under no illusions how hard I have to work to be retained by this coaching team and the effort I have to put in. ‘It starts against Tonga today on an artificial surface on which it is hard to keep your feet. Everyone will have to work hard to keep up at scrum time and at rucks so we don’t give away stupid penalties. ‘This is a big game for all of us, including me, and is my chance to impress Vern and to be part of what I think could be a very good time for Scotland going forward.’"}
{"prompt": "It was the match billed by Gary Neville as the 'Dog and Duck versus The Red Lion'. And there were times at Old Trafford when both back lines showed as much defensive acumen as a bunch of hungover, overweight blokes chasing around cluelessly on a muddy park pitch. In the end, however, it was Liverpool who were made to look the more amateurish as Manchester United took their chances to record a resounding win over their old rivals. Michael Carrick, at the heart of United's defence, deals with the threat of Liverpool's Raheem Sterling . Phil Jones, on the right side of United's defence, goes shoulder-to-shoulder with Adam Lallana early on . Dejan Lovren reflects on an incredibly disappointing afternoon for Liverpool against their old rivals . On another afternoon, Raheem Sterling might have succeeded in his personal duel with David De Gea and claimed a hat-trick. Frankly, Mario Balotelli might have done likewise in the second-half but for the Spanish goalkeeper's defiant, dominant performance. It could have been 3-3, even 5-3 to Liverpool. But somehow, through a combination of De Gea's brilliance, some defensive improvisation and, most importantly, clinical finishing, United emerged victorious. It was most definitely a case of square pegs into round holes with the team selections. Louis van Gaal once again reverted to the back three that has made United look so vulnerable this season. Nobody looks entirely comfortable - still - but the Dutch coach hoped the inclusion of Michael Carrick in the centre would act as a lightning rod for the nervousness this system usually generates. Either side of him was Jonny Evans, barely back from his injury lay-off but needed after Marcos Rojo picked up another injury in training on Saturday, and Phil Jones. Liverpool favoured a back three as well, with Glen Johnson, Martin Skrtel and Dejan Lovren matching United's approach. Alberto Moreno was on hand to track back if required. Raheem Sterling gets in behind Phil Jones but is denied at the near post by David De Gea . Jones earned himself a booking for this foul on Philippe Coutinho close to the halfway line . Liverpool defender Dejan Lovren competes for the ball with Robin van Persie at Old Trafford . It was bold, especially for a team entering the game off the back of a deflating week that had seen them crash out of the Champions League, but Liverpool started very positively. The chaos that is United's back line this season was evident immediately as Philippe Coutinho whipped in a second-minute corner and United needed several swings of the boot to clear the danger. Marouane Fellaini's tendency to look for a backwards pass rather than an adventurous one heaped unnecessary pressure on Jones and Carrick early on and United certainly didn't look like a side entering the fixture off the back of five consecutive wins. The United back line was carved open for the first time on 11 minutes, caught gawping as Adam Lallana's through pass set Sterling one-on-one with David De Gea, the Spanish goalkeeper standing tall to block in what would become a running theme of the afternoon. 25 seconds later, Liverpool had been punished for the miss in ruthless fashion. Moreno and Joe Allen were confused by Antonio Valencia, who nutmegged the latter and crossed for Wayne Rooney to sweep the ball home. Goalkeeper Brad Jones, in for the woeful Simon Mignolet, didn't exactly cover himself in glory by diving early and completely the wrong way. Wayne Rooney's opener resulted from Antonio Valencia getting past Joe Allen on the right wing . Phil Jones slides in to try and dispossess the dangerous Raheem Sterling . Alberto Moreno slides in on Phil Jones - one of many meaty challenges during the first half . Perhaps former United defender Rio Ferdinand put it best, tweeting: 'The way Valencia just stood up them 3 LFC defenders & Bacardi breezed was nuts.' The way Rooney was allowed to steam in unchecked by any Liverpool defender was as alarming for Rodgers. While Carrick was having the intended effect at centre-half, a model of consistency in his passing and reading of the play, Jones was finding Sterling a handful. He was again rescued by De Gea on 23 minutes, when his England colleague turned him with ease. Jones was senselessly anticipating a cut-back, Sterling left him looking like a statue. Some of the challenges were seismic, as you might expect from this fixture. Jones and Evans went into the book for tripping Coutinho during the first-half, walking a tightrope. Fellaini was booked too, to nobody's surprise. Johnson wasn't injured by one of these thunderous challenges but felt something in his groin and limped off, to be replaced by Kolo Toure. Juan Mata doubled United's lead from an offside position five minutes before half-time but it showed something of Liverpool's lack of confidence that only one of their defenders bothered appealing. Michael Carrick's heat map shows his influence in United's defence . Martin Skrtel gets the better of United striker James Wilson during an aerial battle . Glen Johnson walks off after suffering a first-half injury during the match at Old Trafford . Five minutes into the second-half and United's defensive gremlins surfaced again. Evans played a slack back pass, allowing Sterling to run through one-on-one with De Gea. Again, the goalkeeper prevailed, Old Trafford breathing a sigh of relief. Liverpool continued to push, the game was not up in their eyes. Mario Balotelli, introduced at half-time, was thwarted initially by a superb Jones slide tackle, before De Gea pushed his resultant snapshot against the crossbar. Where United would be without the young keeper is unthinkable. Certainly not in third place, probably not even in the top half. Far more than being a much-needed last line of defence, he's been a match-winner in at least half-a-dozen games this season already. Liverpool's greatest defensive shambles of the afternoon allowed United to wrap it up 20 minutes from the end. Lovren's clearance of Rooney's low ball was atrocious, falling straight to Mata who wisely shifted the ball wide to the unmarked Van Persie. With Jones again diving too soon, the Dutchman swept the ball into an empty net. The Dog and Duck would be proud. Liverpool's defence were caught hopelessly out of position for Van Persie's third .

Mr Mason's binge eating began in his 20s at the time of his father's death and a deterioration in his mother's health. He quit his job as a postman when his weight stopped him from finishing his rounds. As his weight soared he was left unable to stand or walk before finally becoming bed-ridden and being looked after full time by council carers. Firefighters had to demolish the front wall of his former home so they could drive a fork lift truck inside to lift him out and put him into an ambulance when he needed a hernia operation in 2002. Mr Mason was later given a purpose-built housing association home with extra wide doorways so he could move around. His care bill cost taxpayers an estimated £100,000 a year and is believed to have topped £1million.

{"prompt": "Washington (CNN) -- The Justice Department on Tuesday defended its decision to subpoena phone records from Associated Press bureaus and reporters, saying the requests were limited and necessary to investigate a leak of classified information. The AP revealed Monday that federal agents had collected two months of telephone records for some of its reporters and editors without notifying it of the subpoena. In a letter to Gary Pruitt, the news service's president, Deputy Attorney General James Cole said the Justice Department had balanced the public's right to know with national security. \"Any subpoena that is issued should be drawn as narrowly as possible, be directed at relevant information regarding a limited subject matter and should cover a reasonably limited period of time,\" Cole wrote. \"We are required to negotiate with the media organization in advance of issuing the subpoenas unless doing so would pose a substantial threat to the integrity of the investigation. We take this policy, and the interests that it is intended to protect, very seriously and followed it in this matter.\" Justice officials haven't specified the leak that triggered the probe, but the AP has said it believes the investigation focuses on its account of a foiled plot to bomb a U.S. airliner in May 2012. AP blasts feds for phone records search . In response to Cole, Pruitt wrote that government officials \"assured us that the national security concerns had passed\" before it ran the story. \"Indeed, the White House was preparing to publicly announce that the bomb plot had been foiled,\" Pruitt wrote. \"The White House had said there was no credible threat to the American people in May of 2012. The AP story suggested otherwise, and we felt that was important information and the public deserved to know it.\" Speaking Tuesday evening to CNN's Erin Burnett, AP Executive Editor Kathleen Carroll said the news service is \"shocked\" by what unfolded. \"We've never seen anything along the size and scope of this particular investigation,\" she said. In all, federal agents collected records from more than 20 lines, including personal phones and AP phone numbers in New York; Hartford, Connecticut; and Washington, he wrote in a letter of protest to Attorney General Eric Holder. Among those staffers whose phone records were subpoenaed was the news service's Washington bureau chief, Sally Buzbee, AP spokeswoman Ellen Hale said Tuesday. Investigators sought call records from five other reporters and an editor, the AP reported Monday. Carroll said the phone lines were used by about 100 journalists, casting a \"very broad net\" of AP operations \"that have, as far as I know, no particular connection to the story that they (authorities) seem to be investigating.\" Holder said Tuesday that he had stepped aside to avoid any potential conflict of interest in the case and left the decision to subpoena the phone records to Cole. He said his recusal was necessary because he had been questioned by FBI agents as part of the leak probe and wanted to make sure \"that the investigation was seen as independent.\" The story the AP says is at the center of the probe broke the news that the CIA had thwarted an al Qaeda plot to blow up a U.S.-bound jetliner around the anniversary of the killing of Osama bin Laden by American commandos. Sources later told CNN that the operative who was supposed to have carried the bomb had been inserted into al Qaeda's Yemeni affiliate by Saudi intelligence, and that the device had been handed over to U.S. analysts. Holder said the leak being investigated was one of the most serious he has ever seen. \"It put the American people at risk, and that's not hyperbole,\" he said. \"It put the American people at risk, and finding who was responsible for that required very aggressive action.\" It's not the first time the Justice Department has taken flak for seeking the phone records of an AP reporter. In 2002, Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley criticized the department for its subpoenas of John Solomon, an AP writer who had written about an investigation into then-Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-New Jersey. The subpoena also spurred a protest from the journalism association Investigative Reporters and Editors. The Obama administration has launched several high-profile leak probes, leading to the prosecution of two government employees accused of revealing classified information. Thomas Drake, a former National Security Agency official, was sentenced to one year of probation and 240 hours of community service in 2011, while former CIA officer John Kiriakou was sentenced to 30 months in prison after admitting to identifying a covert intelligence officer. Documentary filmmaker Robert Greenwald, whose previous movies have criticized the war in Iraq, Fox News and Walmart, called the administration's pursuit of leakers \"an effort to silence and scare whistleblowers, and to get the press to be quiet and do what it wants them to do.\" \"This is a systemic, continuing problem,\" said Greenwald, whose latest film, \"War on Whistleblowers,\" focuses on the issue. \"It's not a one-off, and it's not an accident, sadly.\" CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said Monday that the subpoenas were likely legal, but go further than previous administrations in pursuing private information of journalists. \"I have never heard of a subpoena this broad,\" Toobin said. The White House had no knowledge of any attempt by the Justice Department to seek the records, spokesman Jay Carney said Tuesday. \"We are not involved with the White House in any decisions made in connection with ongoing criminal investigations as those matters are handled appropriately by the Justice Department independently,\" Carney told reporters at a news conference. Carney said the administration supports the right of the press to pursue investigative journalism, but said a balance must be struck between that right and national security interests. \"The president is a strong defender of the First Amendment and a firm believer in the need for the press to be unfettered in its ability to conduct investigative reporting and to facilitate a free flow of information,\" Carney said. \"He also, of course, recognizes the need for the Justice Department to investigate alleged criminal activity without undue influence.\" CNN's Jessica Yellin, Carol Cratty, Kevin Bohn, Greg Botelho, Joe Sterling and Josh Levs contributed to this report."}

Fordham University in New York sent the notifications in error after the job of contacting applicants was outsourced to a third party company called Student Aid Services. Contained in the email was a message in bold red letters which read: 'Congratulations once again on your admission to Fordham University'. Let down: The aspiring students had applied to Fordham University in the Bronx, New York (above) The words came on Wednesday, two days before . students were told to expect a decision, leading many to believe they had made the grade. After quickly realising their error the university sent out a correction note just a few hours later. The heartbreaking news for many read that the original emails 'do not reflect your status'. In total, Fordham University say that 500 of the 2,500 contacted did not get into the university while the other 2,000 have had their decision deferred. The university apologized in a statement on Thursday and said it was working to find the cause of the problem, to prevent it from happening again. Of the 2,500 people contacted, 500 had been rejected outright while the others have had their decision referred (picture posed by model) A spokesperson said: 'Fordham and its undergraduate admissions staff are acutely aware of the high hopes prospective students and their families have regarding college acceptances. 'The University deeply regrets that some applicants were misled by the financial aid notice. The admission staff is working with S.A.S. to find out what went wrong.' Craig Carroll, the chief executive of Student Aid Services said he was 'devastated by the error'.

She told the New York Times: 'Oversight errors don’t just come about, as you know. 'It occurred when data was transferred from a staging environment to our development environment and it was a member of our database services team who made the error.

Tragic: The 86-year-old shot himself dead in Station Road Doctor's Surgery in Frimley, Surrey, yesterday . In . the first clue to Mr Poingdestre's motives, a resident near the scene . said the gunman was 'quite lonely' because his wife Barbara was in . hospital. The woman, who . asked not to be named, said: 'He was quite lonely because his wife is in . Frimley Park Hospital - she is very poorly. 'She wouldn't have a clue what happened yesterday. 'His . car was parked on the double yellows outside the surgery yesterday - . which makes me think he drove in a hurry from the hospital. 'I've no idea if he was a patient there or not though. 'From the sounds of things, he used a hand gun - an old service revolver.' Neighbours paid tribute to Mr Poingdestre, who they described as a 'quiet' man who 'couldn't cope'. Dennis Kinchen, 70, and Georgina Kinchen, 64, live across from the Poingdestre's semi-detached family home of more than 40 years. Mrs Kinchen, from Frimley, said: 'I don't think Brian could cope with Barbara getting ill. 'He seemed quite nice and always said hello and stopped to talk about the garden, but he was quite quiet recently. 'I know she hasn't been well. Scene: The man, named locally as Brian Poingdestre, is thought to have parked his car outside beforehand . 'Back in January an ambulance was at the house after she fell over in the garden and banged her head quite badly. 'Her head was covered in blood and they took her away but it was a while before the paramedics came. 'I haven't seen Barbara for a while - I know she's ill but she may or may not be in hospital.' Mr . Poingdestre used to park his car on the grass outside the end-of-road . property, which has a white wooden gate by the front path. The front garden is large and the back has a bird table and washing line, visible from the road. Mr Kinchen said he thought Mr Poingdestre had been 'lonely' and 'couldn't cope' with his wife's ill health. Mr Kinchen said: 'He was a nice guy but pretty quiet. We've lived here about 20 years so you'd think we'd know more about him. 'We didn't even know he had kids but he does have a son called Guy who's about 60-odd. 'We've never seen him come to the house though in all the time we've been here. 'I do think he was just lonely and couldn't cope.' The Poingdestres had one son who was believed to be heading up from the Weymouth area of Dorset today. 'He was a nice guy but quite quiet recently. I think he just couldn't cope when Barbara got ill' Gavin Laming, who runs Gavin's Hair Studio, barely 200 yards from the couple's home, has been doing Barbara Poingdestre's hair every week for the last 10 years. He said of yesterday's events: 'It's horrendous. I can't get over it. I don't know what's happened, if it's got too much for him. I can't believe he went to the doctor's surgery and did this.' He said Mrs Poingdestre was 'a lovely, lovely lady' but again that she and her husband were private people. He too had heard she had fallen over a concrete slab in her garden, resulting in being hospitalised. Jas Dhaliwal, who runs JR Wines general store next door, said: 'He was a nice bloke. I think he just couldn't cope. 'He did say he was a bit upset with his wife being in hospital but there was nothing to suggest this would happen.' Mr Poingdestre was a regular customer of his, he said. 'He came and got his veg, a banana, whether he needed a potato or a couple of carrots. 'When I opened the shop the was quite happy because he said: \"We couldn't get our veg here in the past\", because he only ever needed a couple of bits.' He said Mr Poingdestre was just a nice, normal old man, who was friendly and respectable, up early in the morning 'like any other pensioner'. Like others in the area, however, he knew very little about the tragic couple. The Poingdestres' immediate neighbours said they have been living next to Brian and Barbara for years. Investigation: Armed police were scrambled to the scene following reports of gunfire at the GP practice . A car with number plates covered parked very close to Station Road Surgery, where a man shot himself dead . The victim in his 80s was believed to have driven the car to the surgery, walked in and shot himself dead . A neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'They were just a normal couple really. 'We weren't exactly close neighbours - passed the time of day when we saw them but that wasn't often. 'Barbara hasn't been well for a long time - she didn't want to tell us much about it which I understand. 'I think it's age related problems - you know, the problems that come as you get older. 'I saw him last week and he looked OK but I didn't get a chance to speak to him. 'They have a son but he hasn't lived here for a long time - we wouldn't know the reason why.' A . practice manager at Station Road Surgery declined to comment on the . incident or say whether he shot himself after an appointment. Mr Poingdestre is believed to be a patient at the surgery. Other patients claimed only someone who knew their way around the building would find the toilets. A worker at The Mane Street barbers opposite the surgery said the community was in a 'sombre mood' today. Patients . have been flocking to the surgery after it re-opened today - all . appointments were cancelled due to the incident at about 11am yesterday. The . woman, who asked not to be named, said: 'The police have moved off the . scene now and patients have been filing into the doctor's all morning. 'People are in a very sombre mood this morning - I certainly feel terribly sad thinking about the poor man who died. 'There's been no word on who he is yet so we're hoping he's not one of our customers.' Surrey Police, who investigated the shooting, said they have passed a file to the coroner. The Ford Focus, parked on a double yellow line with its number plate covered up, has now been removed .

Surrey Coroner's office are expected to open and adjourn an inquest into the death in the next few days. Staff at the surgery, which re-opened today, are being offered support from NHS England. A . spokesperson for NHS England said: 'We are supporting staff at the . Station Road Surgery, Frimley, following the sudden death on the . premises. 'Our thoughts are with the family and friends of the man who died. 'Surrey Police are carrying out an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death. 'The surgery is open to patients as normal.' Police were called to the surgery in Station Road, Frimley, Surrey, at about 10.30am yesterday morning . Shocked residents near the Station Road Surgery said they heard 'gunshots' from inside . Yesterday, a police officer stood guard at the entrance to the sealed-off surgery and a cordon was set up around its car park. Another police officer was stationed by a silver Ford Focus ST parked just 25 yards from the surgery entrance, believed to be Mr Poingdestre's car. Witness Ed Tse, 25, said he heard 'a bang like a gunshot' while working in his father's Chinese takeaway which backs onto the surgery. He described the aftermath at the scene as 'chaotic'. Mr Tse, from Frimley, said: 'I heard a bang around 10.30am and at first I thought it sounded like the bins being collected. 'The surgery is always throwing stuff out so hearing the bang of a bin is quite common but this was louder. 'I went around the corner and there were lots of people and police cars around - it was chaotic. 'I did think the noise was much louder than the usual bin noise and it sounded like a gunshot. 'I've not heard much since but I saw people coming in and out as I came on to Station Road and staff were having to show IDs to police on the door. 'Police were not letting anyone in or out and were taking statements and telling people the surgery was close. I haven't spoken to police myself yet.'"}

A priest sick of 'mixed' Christmas messages has declared war on Santa's elves by hanging one from a noose attached to the front of his church. Jon Knudsen, 45, from Lxkken, Denmark, believes elves are historically minions of Satan and they should not be associated with the Christian festival. Jon claims there is a Trojan horse effect associating previously bad cultural creatures such as elves with the birth of Jesus. Hanged: The elf swings from a rope attached to the church's gallows . In Scandinavia elves were historically thought of as evil spirits in the home which had to be banished by priests. As these bizarre pictures show Jon has now decided to hang an effigy of the cheery Christmas character from the front of his church. Under the prostrate elf hangs a sign reading: 'We renounce the devil and all his deedsand all his being'. Jon has been hanging elves since 2010. He said: 'I think elves are house demons. Chase them out of house and gnome! Jon Knudsen says elves historically served Satan . Jon, who offers to exorcise elves from homes, said people should not 'worship false idols' 'In the old times before Christianity came to Scandinavia they were evil spirits which did bad things to people. 'When Christianity came, people asked priests to help them banish the elves which the priests did in the name of Jesus Christ. 'So now it is against Christianity to have these creatures associated with the birth of Jesus. 'People have tried to mix elves with Christmas and it is not right.'

{"prompt": "By . Darren Boyle for MailOnline . The owner of a wildlife park where a woman zoo keeper was mauled to death by a tiger has described how he fired a shot at the animal. Sarah McClay, 24, was pounced on in the keeper's corridor of the tiger house at South Lakes Wild Animal Park in Cumbria before she was dragged by the back of the neck into a den and then to an outside enclosure. David Gill, who designed the tiger house and set up the park in Dalton-in-Furness from scratch, told a inquest jury how he ran to the scene when he heard on the park radio that male Sumatran tiger Padang 'had got Sarah'. Sarah McClay, left died after she was mauled by a tiger at the South Lakes Wild Animal Park in Cumbria . The park's owner David Gill said he ran to save Ms Clay's life and shoot the tiger but couldn't get a clear shot . He jumped out of a digger 80 yards away and ran towards a fence on the side of the enclosure where he saw the tiger with Miss McClay. Mr Gill said: 'He was looking at me and he was sort of sat there. I took real good care to look at Sarah. She didn't move at all. She was completely still, no movement in the slightest.' Staff members had retrieved firearms as part of their emergency procedures and he grabbed a shotgun from a colleague, he said. A maintenance worker broke down the entrance door followed by Mr Gill as they went into the corridor where Miss McClay had been working. The inquest in Kendal has previously heard that the corridor door to the tigers' dark den was open as were two internal gates which allowed the animals to roam in and out to the paddock. The area was made secure as efforts were then made to capture Padang and female Sumatran tiger Alisha, who came in of her own accord. Mr Gill said he then swapped weapons and took a rifle as he made his way back to the side of the enclosure. He said: 'I got a visual of the tiger. I could not get a shot because of banking and trees . 'Sarah was below the tiger.' Mr Gill said he ran as fast as possible to the tiger enclosure but the animal was standing over Ms McClay . A staff member then radioed to say she had a view of Miss McClay and the tiger from the top of the penguin walkway. Mr Gill said: 'I then ran like crazy to get round there. I could see the tiger but unfortunately it was stood right over Sarah. 'Again I couldn't get a clean shot without the risk of shooting her. I decided to to take a shot at the top of the tiger's shoulder which was the highest point visible but at the moment the rifle went off the tiger just ran off straight back into the tiger house.' Both tigers were then confined into the house which was fully locked and bolted, he said. The inquest heard that Mr Gill had 18 years experience of working with big cats . He added: 'Obviously everyone was on the way, the emergency services. 'The emergency procedure I will say went to plan. Everybody did what they were supposed to. I was very proud of how they all worked.' The jury of six women and four men has heard that systems were place in to ensure that animals and keepers remained apart at all times through indoor and outdoor compartments connected by lockable self-closing doors. Within the tiger enclosure was a light den and a dark den for the animals which keepers were required to enter in the course of routine duties such as cleaning and feeding. The court heard that a bolt on the top of the dark den door was found to be defective in the hours following her death on May 24 last year but it could not be said when the damage occurred. An environmental health officer told the jury that the bolt could not be held back and it would bang against the frame when it tried to close, which left a gap of between 20mm and 25mm. Mr Gill said he was unable to get a clear shot at the tiger as it was standing directly over Ms McClay, pictured . The jury has heard that the door was slightly open after the alarm was raised and was not locked either by the top bolt and bottom bolt, and was not padlocked across the middle. Mr Gill said he was with police officers as the door was later inspected. He said: 'It was the case I believe that the door did not close when it was held open at a certain angle. 'It did that once. I was holding the door open for quite a long time while they (the police) inspected the area.' He said it happened only once out of 10 to 12 times he went to close it. The inquest has heard that the Sumatran tigers were on their weekly fast on the day of Miss McClay's death but he said that lack of food would not have made them 'more aggressive'. He explained: 'You have to try to recreate what happens in the wild. The idea is to try to empty the system as nature intends. If not they become very fat and lethargic.' The jury was told that Miss McClay had fed the jaguar big cats in the adjoining enclosure shortly before the attack and had food ready in the corridor for an Amur tiger which was locked in a den. Mr Gill agreed he was a 'hands-on owner' and said he had 18 years of experience of working with tigers. He said the park was subject to a major inspection every six years and roughly annual spot checks. In that time he said no-one had ever raised concerns about the design or operation of the tiger house, he said. The hearing continues tomorrow.

The National Rifle Association on Sunday forcefully stuck to its call for placing armed police officers and security guards in every school as the best way to avoid shootings such as the recent massacre at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. Wayne LaPierre, CEO of the vocal gun rights lobbying organization, said the NRA would push Congress to pay for more school security guards and would coordinate efforts to put former military and police offers in schools as volunteer guards. 'If it's crazy to call for putting police and armed security in our schools to protect our children, then call me crazy,' LaPierre said in a broadcast interview. 'I think the American people think it's crazy not to do it. It's the one thing that would keep people safe. Scroll Down for Video . On NBC's Meet the Press National Rifle Association chief Wayne LaPierre Sunday refused to support new gun control legislation and maintained his support for putting armed guards and police in schools . Speaking on NBC's 'Meet the Press' LaPierre also contended that any new efforts by Congress to regulate guns or ammunition would not prevent mass shootings. His comments on NBC's 'Meet the Press' reinforced the position that the NRA took on Friday when it broke its weeklong silence on the shooting rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School. That stand has described by some lawmakers as tone-deaf. Senator Charles Schumer, says LaPierre blames everything but guns for a series of mass shootings in recent years. 'Trying to prevent shootings in schools without talking about guns is like trying to prevent lung cancer without talking about cigarettes,' Schumer said. The NRA plans to develop a school emergency response program that would include volunteers from the group's 4.3 million members to help guard children, and has named former Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., as national director of the program. Hutchinson said local districts should make decisions about armed guards in schools. The National Rifle Association remained defiant amid calls for more gun restrictions in the wake of the Newtown tragedy, calling instead for armed guards in American schools . 'I've made it clear that it should not be a mandatory law, that every school has this. There should be local choice, but absolutely, I believe that protecting our children with an armed guard who is trained is an important part of the equation,' he told ABC's 'This Week.' LaPierre said that now the United States is spending $2 billion to train police in Iraq and asked why federal funds could not be transfered to train school guards to protect schools in the United States. He also spoke about restricting the size of ammunition magazines and clips and said: 'I don't believe that's going to make one difference. There are so many different ways to evade that, even if you had that. 'You had that for 10 years when Senator Dianne Feinstein passed that ban in 1994. It was on the books. Columbine occurred right in the middle of it - it didn't make any difference.' Senator Feinstein was the author of a 1994 ban on semi-automatic weapons which expired in 2004. She has recently announced that she will attempt to write new legislation on those types of weapon next year. No new regulations: NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre broke his organization's silence on Friday rejecting new gun control measures and calling for more security and guns in schools . Divided: Wayne LaPierre's statement was interrupted twice by protests blaming the NRA for a culture of violence . 'I know there’s a media machine in this country that wants to blame guns every time something happens,' LaPierre said, but he insisted that an armed guard might have been able to stop Adam Lanza, the killer in Connecticut. 'If I’m a mom or a dad and I’m dropping my child off at school I’d feel a whole lot safer'. However, the NRA chief did concede that 'nothing is perfect' in the battle to deter crime. LaPierre also trained his sights on mental health care in the United States. 'We have a mental health system in this country that has completely and totally collapsed. We have no national database of these lunatics,' said LaPierre. 'We have a completely cracked mentally ill system that’s got these monsters walking the streets,' The controversial chief said that many states do not put their records of the mentally ill into a national instant check system that is designed to screen them from buying weapons. It's the media: LaPierre blamed violent games like Grand Theft Auto and films like American Psycho for encouraging young people to kill . Hijacked: The NRA broke its silence on Friday but it was a protestor who stole much of the limelight . He also said that the federal gvernment has not invested in a law preventing convicted felons from possessing guns. He said, 'If you want to control violent criminals, take them off the street.' Meanwhile, President Obama has asked Vice President Joe Biden with drawing up new gun legislation - with a deadline of early next month. When asked about this initiative, LaPierre said, 'if it’s a panel that’s just going to be made up of a bunch of people that for the past 20 years has been trying to destroy the Second Amendment, I’m not interested in sitting on that panel…. The NRA is not going to let people lose the Second Amendment in this country.' Passion: Before the NRA's statement on Friday President Obama released a video calling for public support for gun control . Following LaPierre on Meet the Press, Sen. Charles Schumer, D- N.Y., said that the NRA leader is 'so extreme and so tone deaf that he actually helps the cause of us passing sensible gun legislation in the Congress…. He is so doctrinaire and so adamant that I believe gun owners turn against him as well.' Schumer said that LaPierre believes 'the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is good gun with a gun. What about trying to stop the bad guy from getting the gun in the first place? That’s common sense. Most Americans agree with it.' Gun-control advocates reacted with disbelief Friday to LaPierre’s call for armed guards in every school and his blaming of Hollywood films, video games, and popular music for school shootings such as the one in Connecticut.

Newton dominated the Las Vegas show scene in his prime as a singer and entertainer, delivering such hits as Danke Schoen which was famously used as the soundtrack for the movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off. In flusher days, Redfin reported the crooner's Casa de Shenandoah property featured flamingos, South African penguins and Arabian horses. Newton along with his family and menagerie moved to a downsized Las Vegas estate, the website revealed. Redfin noted that the estate comes complete with an actual jumbo jet and a terminal - to see the luxurious beast take off and land - as well as an actual 'car museum' for good measure. Luxury: The estate - which Newton lost in bankruptcy to CSD LLC - has the nickname Casa de Shenandoah . Tropical: Lagoon style swimming pools with rocky waterfalls are a prominent feature on the desert estate . Equestrian paradise: The sprawling property boasts 37 stables for horses on site . There are 37 horse stables, an equestrian pool and countless arenas for riding, making it an equine paradise if there ever was one. But horses were not Newton's only fascination, as Redfin explains. The property has also been home to countless other animals that the renowned entertainer brought home to play and stay, including a plethora of exotic ones. Menagerie: Charlie the penguin, seen in 2010, once lived on Wayne Newton's estate . Lawns for days: Lakes and sprawling greenery used to house a range of exotic animals back when Newton was the owner of the 40 acre property in Las Vegas . Back in the day: Flamingos, South African penguins and Arabian horses used to trot about the estate . Fly on over for a visit! The estate even has a jumbo jet terminal for friends to land in . Sprawling swimming pools shaped like tropical lagoons and decorated with waterfalls and rock formations provide ample space for splashing about and escaping the Nevada heat. Newton's career in entertainment was topped off with an appearance on Dancing With The Stars in 2007, during which the singer partnered up with Cheryl Burke. The Vegas superstar, who is married to attorney Kathleen McCrone, continues to tour worldwide with his music. The couple have one daughter, Lauren, and Newton has another adopted daughter from his previous marriage to Elaine Okamura. Welcome: The front gates of the property give an indication of the luxury inside . Not for humans! The owner can make use of this equestrian pool, designed for horses . Anyone for tennis? A somewhat unkempt tennis court occupies a tiny portion of the property . Plenty of room to sleep: Aside from the main house there are also seven separate smaller houses . Waiting to take off: There is a prime seating area where guests can wait to board their jumbo jets . Added extra: The next lucky owner will need to have a pilot on hand - or learn to be one . Splashing about: The property offers plenty of room to take a dip in its sprawling pools . Desert home: The property would reach soaring temperature heights being in Nevada . Relax: Whoever buys the home can enjoy this living room . Lively: A tree-lined lane lane is pictured in this snap, taken back in 2010, when peacocks were still roaming the yards ."}
{"prompt": "(CNN) -- World champion Casey Stoner has given himself the perfect chance to return to the top of the MotoGP standings after qualifying in pole position for Sunday's Portuguese Grand Prix. The Australian set the fastest time of one minute 37.188 seconds at Estoril on Saturday to head off Honda teammate Dani Pedrosa and British rider Cal Crutchlow. It was Stoner's second pole position this season and the 35th of his top-level motorcycling career as he bids to close the four-point gap on series leader Jorge Lorenzo. The Spaniard failed to qualify on the front row of the grid at the circuit for the first time in his career, with Yamaha's 2010 world champion finishing fourth fastest ahead of American teammate Ben Spies and San Carlo Honda Gresini's Alvaro Bautista. Crutchlow's Monster Yamaha Tech 3 teammate Andrea Dovizioso headed the third row in seventh ahead of Pramac Racing's Hector Barbera, who finished in front of seven-time world champion Valentino Rossi to be the top Ducati rider. Rossi's Ducati teammate Nicky Hayden was 10th, with the American failing to follow up his third-place qualifying effort at the last race in Spain. Stoner won that event in Jerez, having started fifth on the grid, but finished third in the season opener in Qatar despite claiming pole position. Saturday's session was marred when French rider Randy de Puniet crashed into Colin Edwards, leaving the 38-year-old American with a broken collarbone."}
{"prompt": "A Native American chief has called for a boycott of FedEx until the Washington Redskins - who play at FedExField - change their team name. Osage Nation Chief Geoffrey M. Standing Bear wrote a letter telling tribal employees to stop using the service until the name is changed 'to something less inflammatory and insulting'. 'Other reports reveal the name Redskins is derived from a horrible former practice of removing the skin of Native people for the purpose of collecting bounties,' he wrote, KRMG reported. His tribe added in a news release that Redskins owner Daniel Snyder 'chooses to stick with a brand which dictionaries define as disparaging and offensive'. Scroll down for video . Boycott: Osage Nation Chief Geoffrey M. Standing Bear has written a directive to all tribal employees telling them to stop using FedEx until the Washington Redskins - who play at FedExField - change their name . FedEx bought the naming rights to the stadium in a 27-year deal for $207 million in 1999. The tribe, which has 18,000 members, is based in Osage County, Oklahoma. But it is not the only one planning to boycott the services. The National Congress of American Indians has spoken out against the name, while the Native Voice Network, which represents Native American organizations, has also targeted FedEx. The Native Voice Network, which says the name has a negative, dehumanizing effect on children, told CNN that they supported Standing Bear's call to boycott the company. 'We're very proud of their position and we'd love to see other tribal communities do the same,' she said. As well as owning the naming rights, FedEx's chairman, president and CEO Fred Smith is also part of the team's ownership group. Patrick Fitzgerald, FedEx's senior vice president of marketing and communications, said the company is proud of its links to the stadium, which is used by a wide-range of groups. 'Offensive': FedEx bought the naming rights to the stadium in a $207 million deal in 1999 - but now Native American tribes have attacked the company for supporting the team name, which they say is insulting . Defense: Team owner Dan Synder, pictured in August, has insisted that the name honors Native Americans . But he added that 'we continue to direct questions about the name to the franchise owner'. Snyder previously said the name 'captures the best of who we are and who we can be, by staying true to our history and honoring the deep and enduring values our name represents'. The owner insists that the name honors Native Americans, rather than disparages them. The Osage Nation, which is based in Pawhuska, is among several Oklahoma-based tribes that have called on the team to change its name. Those tribes include the state's five most influential -including the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Muscogee (Creek) and Seminole nations - that represent more than 500,000 tribal citizens across the U.S."}
{"prompt": "(CNN) -- Sheryl Sandberg wants young girls to \"ban bossy,\" but for those of us soon-to-graduate, just-graduated and will-I-ever-graduate ladies just entering the working world, there's another word that's even more toxic. That word is \"pushy.\" At least, that's what my Lean In Circle thinks. A new book by Sandberg, \"Lean In: For Graduates,\" targets women like us, but we were already paying attention. My Circle is all 20-somethings with dreams of media industry success. We wanted our group to exist as a third-wave feminist answer to boys clubs, with their oak-paneled rooms and clouds of cigar smoke. We share job announcements, work dilemmas and interviewing tips and tricks. A guy recently asked me, \"Lean In Circle -- is that, like, a book club?\" Sort of. Not quite. According to Sandberg's Lean In Foundation, 14,000 Lean In Circles meet regularly around the globe, and we don't just reread \"Lean In\" over mimosas. Lean In Circles were conceived as \"small peer groups that allow you to learn and share in an atmosphere of confidentiality and trust.\" The Washington Post described the ethos as \"Alcoholics Anonymous fused with Girl Scouts,\" and I have yet to find a more accurate depiction of my particular Circle environment. And so we formed, and rallied around our Circle mission: to sit at the table and push back against \"pushy\" to find our first jobs. 'Wait your turn' My mom was one of many who cautioned their daughters with the same advice: Wait your turn, don't be pushy. But when I was 22, still in college, interning at a magazine in New York City and illegally subletting a run-down room, that advice just wasn't cutting it anymore. I was one semester away from graduation and the real world, and I was dreading it. One of my internship supervisors jokingly introduced me to a colleague: \"This is Julia Carpenter, and she is terrified that she will graduate without a job.\" It was true. Many of my peers moved back home with their parents to wait out this horrific economy, and unequivocally, they were miserable. Many of my friends in journalism moved to cities like New York or San Francisco and waited months for a job. Some worked multiple part-time jobs to make ends meet, and every day without a lead meant more hope slipping away. When I was reading \"Lean In\" within the mouse-ridden confines of my apartment, Sandberg's words stoked the long-squelched dreams that had always hovered in the top pages of my journals. As an English major and a journalism student, many of the feminist tenets in \"Lean In\" weren't new to me, but they also weren't applicable to me yet. She urges women to find supportive significant others who will see a relationship as a partnership, not a trade-off. Many of her stories about the intersection of family planning, motherhood and careerdom didn't have much of an effect. Those were things I'd been reading about in women's studies textbooks for years, examples of how progressive society had helped women out of the home and into the workplace and back. What was new to me was her practical application of these sometimes abstract concepts. For every lesson, Sandberg had a story to share about boardroom drama at Facebook, Google and elsewhere. In my young life, I hadn't had any Peggy Olson moments in which men looked up my skirt in the office or openly critiqued me for being a woman in a college classroom. Instead, Sandberg's vivid depictions of workplace inequality -- of women who were constantly overlooked for the promotion, of female executives too shy to raise their hands in team discussion -- resonated as examples of the gender bias traps still harming women's success. I had been passed on for projects because of reasons like \"Why would a girl be interested in politics?\" and the word \"bitch\" had been thrown at me to end a conversation. Sandberg's examples provided simple solutions: Speak with purpose. Sit at the table. Sandberg writes that many women struggle to be bold in workplace. In my case, it was in the world of job hunting. We fear that putting ourselves out there means we will be perceived as \"pushy.\" No one wants to be called that dreaded word just as she's trying to get a job. I realized that not pushing hard enough for the job that I wanted was even scarier than not having a job. I feared that I would be waiting in the wings, clutching my pages-long rÃ©sumÃ© and feeling insecure, as droves of confident, talented men dared to sit at the table. I knew to get that dream job, I was going to have to push forward and sit right beside those guys, just as Sandberg wrote. 'Is there a job there for me?' Closing that confidence gap isn't easy, especially after a lifetime of \"Wait your turn.\" I read that when Sandberg was job hunting -- honestly, more like \"job picking\" -- then-Google CEO Eric Schmidt gave her some invaluable advice, which ultimately became my guidepost. \"Only one criterion matters when picking a job -- fast growth.\" In my own job hunt, in the midst of interviewing and applying, I found myself playing the same neurotic games many of my female peers have copped to: \"Did they even get my application?\" \"Oh my God, they hated my application\" and of course, \"Why did I even send in an application, I suck.\" On the other hand, men send in applications even if they meet just some of the listed qualifications. \"I've been really forward (almost to the point of being pushy?) in the last year,\" a member of our Lean In Circle told me. \"But the only consequence there might've been for that is not getting a response to an application.\" Not all of Sandberg's advice resonated with my Circle. Business cards and job titles don't mean much to us, and unlike many of Sandberg's contemporaries, we've come up in a startup culture that eschews formalism. \"A lot of my job search happened over beers, over shared criticisms, over social media interactions,\" said one member of my Circle. \"If I said some of the suggested scripts she uses in the book, the person I was talking to would think I was a robot. When members of my Circle discuss job prospects -- which we're doing ever-more-frequently as members prep for graduation -- the first question we ask isn't \"What's the position?\" Instead, it's \"What would you be doing?\" The day before I graduated from college, I received a job offer from the magazine where I had interned while reading \"Lean In.\" The job was awesome. I would be living in a city I loved, working with amazing people and doing something I knew I was good at. But my heart was still set on another opportunity. A member of my Circle had referred me for a sweet spot on the Washington Post's digital engagement team, but after a few rounds of interviews I was still waiting for an answer. \"You just have to wait,\" people told me. My newly Sheryl-fied inner voice said otherwise. I called and explained the situation. \"Is there a job there for me?\" I remember saying. \"We were going to offer you the job tomorrow,\" my now-boss said. \"So -- what are you thinking?\" 'That's my girl' At a recent brunch with a college friend, she told me she's happy at her job, but looking for the next step, hopefully a new gig that will allow her to travel and improve her skills. \"I want to e-mail these giants in my field to introduce myself and ask about job openings,\" she said. \"But I don't want to. I don't want to impose. They're going to be like 'Who is this girl? Why is she e-mailing me?' And I know my male colleagues wouldn't think twice. They'd send that e-mail.\" I immediately made a mental note to add her to our Circle. I know my Circle members would say it's an ongoing struggle for women in the workplace, and you have to lean in bit by bit. They're right. If anything else, you need to do it to improve the quality of workplaces for other women, even on the days when the confidence gap thwarts your plans to proceed boldly. So even when I couldn't find a connection with Sandberg's discussion of work-life balance and motherhood or the buttoned-up culture of top tech executives, \"Lean In\" can't just be written off as a book for mid-level career women. For me and my Circle -- all women new to our first job or still in college and looking for that first job -- Sandberg's simple suggestion to proceed boldly, empowered us to look at the job hunt and our workplace interactions. We're wary of the gender gap not just in salary, but in how it shapes discussion and assignment in our offices. Even in the early days of a new gig, we're committed to closing that confidence (and achievement) gap. That's something we can take away from the pages. That's why a Circle is more than just a book club. In the middle of a conference call at work last week, I jumped into the conversation. \"I can explain this,\" I said, and launched into a short description of a project my team and I had been rolling out. \"When you said 'I can explain this,' you actually leaned in,\" a female colleague said to me afterward. \"You physically leaned in closer to the desk. I was like, 'That's my girl.'\" How did you land your first job? Share your experiences in the comments, on Twitter @CNNLiving or on CNN Living's Facebook page."}

{"prompt": "U.S. President Barack Obama was personally informed of phone tapping against German Chancellor Angela Merkel, which may have begun as early as 2002, according to German media. As the damaging espionage scandal widened, Bild am Sonntag newspaper quoted U.S. intelligence sources as saying that National Security Agency chief Keith Alexander had briefed Obama on the operation against Merkel in 2010. 'Obama did not halt the operation but rather let it continue,' the newspaper quoted a high-ranking NSA official as saying. Scroll down for video . Unhappy: Merkel suggested at an EU gathering that she was not placated by talks with President Obama . News weekly Der Spiegel reported that leaked NSA documents showed that Merkel's phone had appeared on a list of spying targets since 2002, and was still under surveillance weeks before Obama visited Berlin in June. As a sense of betrayal spread in many world capitals allegedly targeted by the NSA, European leaders are calling for a new deal with Washington on intelligence gathering that would maintain an essential alliance while keeping the fight against terrorism on track. Germany will send its own spy chiefs to Washington soon to demand answers. Meanwhile several thousand protesters gathered in Washington Saturday to push for new U.S. legislation to curb the NSA's activities. Swiss president Ueli Maurer warned that the scandal risked 'undermining confidence between states'. 'We don't know if we're only seeing the tip of the iceberg or if other governments are acting in the same ruthless manner,' he told the Schweiz am Sonntag weekly. Anger: German Chancellor Angela Merkel (left) and Brazil's Dilma Rousseff (right) have both voiced concerns over the NSA's infiltration of the online communications of foreigners . Merkel confronted Obama with the snooping allegations in a phone call on Wednesday saying that such spying would be a 'breach of trust' between international partners. The suspicion also prompted Berlin to summon the U.S. ambassador - a highly unusual move between the close allies. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung reported without citing its sources that Obama had told Merkel during their call that he had been unaware of any spying against her. Der Spiegel said he told her that if he had been informed of the operation he would have stopped it at once. Other media reports said that Obama's National Security Advisor Susan Rice had also told German officials the president knew nothing of the spying. Merkel's office declined to comment on what he told her during their conversation. The White House has said it is not . monitoring Merkel's phone calls and will not do so in future, but it has . refused to say whether it did previously. Bild . am Sonntag said that Obama wanted to be informed in detail about . Merkel, who has played a decisive role in the eurozone debt crisis and . is widely seen as Europe's most powerful leader. Demands: Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta, . left, speaks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, right, yesterday during a . round-table meeting at an European Union summit in Brussels . Under fire: President Barack Obama, standing next to Vice President Joe Biden, speaks in the White House yesterday . German Chancellor Angela Merkel checking her mobile phone in May 2012 . As a result, the report said, the NSA stepped up its surveillance of her communications, targeting not only the mobile phone she uses to conduct business for her conservative Christian Democratic Union party but also her encrypted official device. Merkel only acquired the latter handset over the summer. Bild said U.S. intelligence specialists were then able to monitor the content of her conversations as well as text messages, which Merkel sends by the dozen each day to key associates. Only the specially secured land line in her office was out of the reach of the NSA, which sent the intelligence gathered straight to the White House bypassing the agency's headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland, according to the report. Bild and Spiegel described a hive of spy activity on the fourth floor of the US embassy in central Berlin, a stone's throw from the government quarter, from which the United States kept tabs on Merkel and other German officials. Spiegel cited a classified 2010 document indicating that U.S. intelligence had 80 high-tech surveillance offices worldwide in cities including Paris, Madrid, Rome, Prague, Geneva and Frankfurt. If the spying against Merkel began in 2002, it would mean the United States under then president George W. Bush targeted her while she was still the country's chief opposition leader, three years before she became chancellor. Bild said Merkel's predecessor Gerhard Schroeder was also in the NSA's sights because of his vocal opposition to the US invasion of Iraq and close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. As anger simmered in Berlin, Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich sharpened his tone. 'Surveillance is a crime and those responsible must be brought to justice,' he told Bild. A poll for the newspaper found that 76 percent of Germans believe Obama should apologise for the alleged spying on Merkel, and 60 percent said the scandal had damaged German-U.S. ties. The scandal derived from documents acquired from U.S. fugitive defence contractor Edward Snowden by Spiegel. The Social Democrats' chief whip Thomas Oppermann told Bild that German MPs would now like to question Snowden. 'Snowden's accounts seem credible while the U.S. government apparently lied to us about this matter.'"}

{"prompt": "Washington (CNN) -- Ever since Watergate became the shorthand for a government run amok, the political clichÃ© of our time has been about the political lesson of that era: That the coverup can be worse than the crime. Apply that clichÃ© to Benghazi -- and questions about the motive for removing the terror link from talking points about the Libyan attack in the heat of an election. Maybe there's a corollary question that we ought to be asking: In politics, when did spin trump everything, even the truth? We're in dangerous territory right now, although the president himself seems to be having none of it, calling the investigation a \"political circus.\" Sure it is. But in the center ring is something that still begs an explanation, despite the president's dismissiveness: How -- and why-- did the account of what happened at Benghazi (i.e. the infamous talking points) go through a dozen iterations, beginning with a fairly detailed description of the potential involvement of al Qaeda that morphed over the course of a day into a simple, gauzy, bland (and false) theory? Administration officials say, of course, that this is just part of the regular, interagency \"process\" of consultation that occurs before information is released. In other words, this is the way intelligence always gets scrubbed and vetted. And in this case, don't forget, the information was being released to members of Congress on the intelligence committees, so they could speak in public with some clarity (!) on Benghazi. But that also means the information was going to Republicans -- in the heat of the fall election -- so antennae were up. What's more, the bureaucratic armor was on -- between people at the State Department and the CIA, each trying to make sure their agency wasn't thrown under the bus for the obvious failures in Benghazi. All in all, just another day in Washington. Let's try to deconstruct the accusations. First, the notion that politics was somehow at play is, of course, true. Was it 30% or 50% or 80% of the problem? Hard to say. What we do know is this: In an e-mail, Victoria Nuland, the State Department's spokeswoman at the time, makes the point that a key paragraph in the talking points -- containing context and detail about five other attacks in Benghazi -- \"could be abused by members of Congress to beat up the State Department for not paying attention to warnings so why would we feed that either ... \" She's right: Republicans and Mitt Romney would no doubt have accused the administration of not paying enough attention to warning signs. But since it was also the truth -- or an important part of it -- why suppress it? Then there's the rest of the story, which may even be more dispositive. Although the U.S. ambassador to Libya lost his life, the exact nature of the Benghazi operation is tricky. White House spokesman Jay Carney says the White House changed the wording from \"consulate\" to \"diplomatic facility\" to be more accurate. So what does that mean? Thanks to the digging of Glenn Kessler in The Washington Post, it looks very much like the Benghazi consulate \"was not a consulate at all but basically a secret CIA operation.\" And, as Kessler also points out, the internal Accountability Review Board, in its investigation, tiptoed around the delicate matter: The U.S. Special Mission in Benghazi, it said, \"was never a consulate and never formally notified to the Libyan government.\" In other words, this was a hit on a CIA outpost, resulting in the death of an ambassador who happened to be there at the time. That helps to explain the pushback from the State Department, which was publicly taking the heat -- and didn't want the CIA-driven talking points to add to the idea that they had failed to protect their own. In addition, State had been pretty mum on the whole picture, and Nuland didn't want the talking points to reflect more than she had been allowed to share publicly, so she naturally objected -- on behalf of her \"building's leadership.\" The bottom line: That the more complex version of the truth -- previous recent attacks, previous threats linked to al Qaeda, the presence of \"Islamic extremists\" -- was somehow lost in translation and what emerged instead was something that turned out to be utterly false: a claim that the attack was \"spontaneously inspired by the protests at the U.S. embassy in Cairo.\" In the end, there are two parts to this Benghazi brouhaha. The president called the controversy a \"sideshow,\" and he's right: Republicans are trying to fund-raise off of this and hurt Hillary Clinton. And maybe the president was goading them, knowing that if they go overboard, the public will turn on them. But the president's dismissive attitude towards the whole mess willfully neglects the second part of the problem. He says, incredulously, \"who executes some sort of coverup or effort to tamp things down for three days? So the whole thing defies logic.\" Alas, it doesn't. Nothing in life happens in a vacuum, and life in Washington is no different. In the context of the closing months of a presidential campaign, three days can be an eternity. And spinning across the finish line is all that counts. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gloria Borger."}

{"prompt": "By . Peter Campbell . PUBLISHED: . 19:22 EST, 31 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:02 EST, 1 February 2013 . Grilling: Chairman Lady Margaret Hodge said the evidence given by accountancy bosses was 'shocking' and 'laughable' Britain's biggest accounting firms yesterday said they were ‘proud’ of making billions helping companies avoid UK tax. In ‘shocking’ evidence to MPs, bosses told how they regularly advised wealthy corporate clients to use offshore havens and legal loopholes to minimise UK tax payments. They admitted to having more than 200 offices in tax havens such as the Cayman Islands or Switzerland. One even confessed to selling policies which had a high chance of later being declared unlawful in court. Helping companies avoid tax earned them more than £2billion a year, said the four firms – KPMG, PWC, Ernst & Young and Deloitte. The testimony was condemned as ‘shocking’ and ‘depressing’ by MPs on the public accounts committee. Astonishingly, each of the executives in turn said they were ‘proud’ of their work. Kevin Nicholson, head of tax at PWC, said: ‘We are giving the best advice we can to clients on the options which they have. ‘I don’t see anything wrong with that.’ But committee chairman Margaret Hodge said Mr Nicholson’s company’s activity ‘stinks’. She said the taxman had little hope of . competing in a ‘David and Goliath’ battle against the accountancy giants . paid millions to help companies avoid tax. Mr Nicholson yesterday admitted selling policies which had a 75 per cent chance of being later declared unlawful. Mrs Hodge replied: ‘I find that shocking.’ It also emerged that the companies all send senior tax partners to HMRC or the Treasury to help draft new legislation. When they return to their firms, the companies use the new-found knowledge of loopholes to devise new ways for corporations to avoid paying full dues to the taxman. Mrs Hodge said it was ‘depressing’ that such ‘clever’ people had chosen to work ‘in an area which reduces the available resources for us to build schools, hospitals and transport infrastructure’. She told the companies they should be barred from receiving government contracts worth millions if they deliberately advised their wealthy firms and individuals to cut the tax they pay to the Treasury. But the firms were unrepentant. Bill Dodwell, head of tax at Deloitte, said: ‘We help make the tax system work.’ Another boss, Jane McCormick of KPMG, insisted: ‘Our main purpose is to help our clients pay their tax’ – a statement Mrs Hodge described as ‘laughable’. The four heads of tax were grilled for almost three hours in the House of Commons in the midst of huge public controversy over the low tax bills paid by multinationals such as Amazon, Google and Starbucks. Dismissed: Jane McCormick from KPMG said her company's job was to 'help clients pay tax' - a claim Margaret Hodge described as 'laughable' In his speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos last week, Prime Minister David Cameron said there were ‘some forms of avoidance that have become so aggressive that I think it is right to say these raise ethical issues’. He warned he would use Britain’s presidency of the G8 to press for action from the world’s most powerful governments. But the firms denied their practices were ‘aggressive’ and were keen to distinguish between evasion – which is illegal and which they all said they would not engage in – and avoidance, which is taking advantage of incentives within the system."}
{"prompt": "They come in all sizes and shapes, athletes do, small and tall, round and lean. They come with all kinds of personalities as well. Some are cheerful as a cheerleader and sunny as a summer's morn. They do more than just impress you, on the field or off; they delight you. Precious few have been the equal of Tony Gwynn, when it comes to a combination of superhuman prowess plus an everyman's way of coming across not as someone to idolize but more like your drop-by-for-coffee neighbor next door. When he died Monday, cut down at 54 by a mouth cancer that spread, Major League Baseball mourned. Baseball Hall of Famer Tony Gwynn dies . The statistics of Anthony Keith Gwynn are so off-the-chart absurd, they almost make a baseball lover laugh out loud: In the 20 seasons he played (all for the same team, the San Diego Padres), he did not slug home runs the way Babe Ruth or Hank Aaron or Barry Bonds did; on the contrary, a mere 135 homers in all that time? Ha, you would think this Gwynn must have been a 98-pound weakling, rather than the chubby-cheeked, tubby-tummied specimen that he was. What he did do was hit the ball. In his two decades, in 9,288 official at-bats, Gwynn struck out a grand total of 434 times. A pitcher couldn't get a pitch by him. It was the old \"like trying to throw a lamb chop past a wolf\" kind of joke. You chucked it, Tony Gwynn knocked it. A single to left, to center, to right, wherever he darn well pleased. He looked like a slow-pitch softball batter who decided to poke a ball anywhere he liked. Except he did this against young, rock-abbed, iron-armed men who could hurl a hardball between 90 and 100 mph. Gwynn's lifetime tally of 3,141 hits exceeded  that of Rod Carew, Al Kaline, Roberto Clemente, Ruth, Joe DiMaggio, Lou Gehrig... His career batting average of .338 was the kind kids fantasize about when they are up-and-comers, watching videos of themselves, trying to learn how to hit. The ballpark figures this Hall of Famer etched into the game's record books are exceptional. Yet there was so much more to Gwynn: a perpetually happy and humble human being. A couple of examples, just to get the ball rolling: . The year was 1984 and the San Diego Padres had made it to the World Series at last. Game 1 was about to be played there in southernmost Southern California, in a town known far more for its beauty than its baseball. Tony Gwynn sat in a dugout, taking on all comers, talking to reporters and teammates and TV cameramen and vendors and batboys. \"Don't you just love baseball?\" Gwynn asked at one point of no one in particular. He and the Padres were expected by many to lose to the Detroit Tigers, a very strong team that year. \"If we do lose,\" Tony the non-Tiger said, \"hooray for the Tigers. Somebody's going to win, so if it can't be us, hooray for them.\" Don't you just love that? The lack of intensity, solemnity, fear that his observation would be interpreted in some negative way? Kirk Gibson, star of the opposing team, was the kind of guy who would have stared daggers at a teammate who fraternized with the enemy. Gwynn sought them out, trying to find Tigers before the game, eager as a frisky puppy to make friends and then go play. He had a brother, name of Chris, who got to play on his team. In 1996, the Padres were up north in Tony's birthplace of Los Angeles for a big game. It was decided on a clutch 11th-inning double by a pinch-hitter -- yep, Chris Gwynn, the lesser of the Gwynn brothers historically, and it won the division championship for the Padres. \"Aren't you Chris Gwynn's brother?\" a reporter joked. \"I am today!\" Tony exulted. He loved his brother. He loved pretty much everybody. Including his own son, Tony Gwynn Jr., who also made it to the major leagues. Brother and son might not have been in Tony's league (as it were), but those Gwynns, they could play this game. Tony Jr. was succinct and sincere on Twitter when the bad news came Monday: \"Today I lost my Dad, my best friend and my mentor. I'm gonna miss u so much, pops.\" Tony Gwynn and a habit all too common in baseball . He had a cherubic face and a soft and nasal voice, a little bit Walter Payton, a little bit Wayne Newton. He had the torso of a nonathlete and his cheeks were puffed by smokeless tobacco, a habit that likely killed him. He endured oral surgery in 2010 and again in 2012, and there had been a growing dread that his days were numbered. Tony Gwynn is gone? Say it ain't so. He didn't play for New York or St. Louis or San Francisco. He played against them. But he played for all of us, watching him with that bat, waggling it, digging in, smacking a ball where it couldn't be caught. He would smile, patting the other side's fielder on the back, while the rest of us turned to each other, shook our heads and said something like, \"Man, that guy can hit.\""}
{"prompt": "Hong Kong (CNN) -- Amid a glowing sea of candles and rallying calls for justice, a record crowd packed six football pitches at an annual vigil held in Hong Kong to commemorate the 23rd anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. Organizers announced the highest ever turnout of 180,000 people, while police said the figure was closer to 85,000. By even the most conservative estimates, there were 15,000 more attendees than last year. While the vigil typically features singing, speeches, video messages and tributes, the clear highlight of this year's event was a special appearance by Fang Zheng, a former student protester who had both his legs amputated after he was run over by an army tank during the crackdown. Wheeled onto the center of the stage, Zheng, now 46, effusively thanked the crowd for \"twenty-three years of support.\" Over June 3 to 4, 1989, Chinese troops used lethal force to quash a seven-week-long occupation of Beijing's Tiananmen Square by pro-democracy protesters, who were largely comprised of students. Estimates of the numbers killed range from hundreds to thousands of protesters and soldiers. In an outpouring of compassion, a continued sense of injustice, and fears for the future, the vigil attracted a broad spectrum of mourners, ranging from people born after the crackdown to elderly residents who have dutifully come every year. The annual vigil in Hong Kong is the only public commemoration of its kind and scale allowed within China's borders. Volunteer Nicole Lai, 7, handed out bookmarks to passersby at the League of Social Democrats booth alongside her mother. \"Many people died so I'm here to pay my respects,\" she said. Further down Great George Street, a 27-year-old man surnamed Chow held up subversive T-shirts for sale. Although he was only four years old at the time of the crackdown, Chow said he chose to volunteer his services with his friends Monday to \"show his opposition toward the Chinese Communist Party and its disregard for the law.\" Michael Pang, 17, has attended the vigil for the past three years out of a sense of civic responsibility. \"Even though I wasn't alive during June 4, we need to take the initiative to stand up for our rights and tell our citizens that we have the responsibility to say no to the Chinese Communist Party.\" The Hong Kong Federation of Students who took to the stage echoed his sentiment, declaring, \"Our pain and suffering is the same as that of our parents.\" Sitting on bleachers with group of elderly men holding lighted candles in paper cones, 73-year-old Fu Kam-tin said he has been coming to the vigils nearly every year since 1989. Fu, who emigrated from the mainland at age 12, called the Tiananmen massacre \"the most apparent example in China's history of the strong bullying the weak.\" He says he continues to be \"very angry and unsettled by these corrupt officials who are harming our country and harming the world.\" Ms. Chan Shu-ying said she still has a deep impression of attending a protest in 1989 against the crackdown alongside thousands of Hong Kongers in Happy Valley. Now 53, Chan said, \"Coming here every year will fulfill my dream of June 4 being redressed and the democratization of China's political system.\" The bumper crowd gathered in Victoria Park amid a politically turbulent year in both Hong Kong and mainland China. Hong Kong's new Chief Executive, Leung Chun-ying, is due to take office on the first of July after being chosen to lead the special administrative region of China. The lack of universal suffrage and uneasiness over the mainland government's influence over local affairs have long been contentious issues in Hong Kong. Leung is perceived by some to take a hard-line approach toward public freedoms. He has been criticized in recent days for refusing to comment on the vigil and the massacre. China has also encountered multiple political scandals in the run-up to the once-in-a-decade Communist party leadership change this fall, most notably the murky corruption-cum-murder case involving disgraced Chongqing party chief Bo Xilai, and the fleeing of blind human rights activist Chen Guangcheng to the U.S. \"All problems need to be solved; evasion is not a way out,\" Chen said, in an open letter urging the Chinese government to institute democratic reforms and address the Tiananmen incident. His letter was posted to the website of the vigil's organizer, the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China. During Monday's vigil, Alliance chairman Andrew Lee Cheuk-yan took to the stage to lead the crowd in chants of \"Never forget June 4!\", \"Redress June 4!\", \"Persevere to the end!\" Lee said that more than 10,000 visitors had already passed through the temporary Tiananmen Square memorial museum in Sham Shui Po, which opened in late April. He said he hoped last night's cash donations and T-shirt sales would help the alliance establish a permanent museum to commemorate June 4 in Hong Kong."}

{"prompt": "Oscar's host Ellen DeGeneres failed to keep up appearances for sponsor's Samsung during Sunday night's ceremony when she kept posting pictures to Twitter backstage from her own iPhone. Shooting what seemed like a carefully coordinated social-media and advertising blitz in the foot, DeGeneres snapped the now-famous A-list selfie and several other pictures with her Galaxy Note 3 live on air, but when she was off camera, she reverted to her trusty Apple smartphone. Having spent upwards of $25 million over the past five years of Oscar ceremonies at $1.8 million for 30-seconds of advertising space, Samsung would have been dismayed to see their chief rival gatecrashing what should have been a promotional coup for the South Korean firm. Scroll down for video . Publicity coup: It is now famous - dubbed the greatest selfie ever - and was uploaded to the Twitter account of Ellen DeGeneres after being taken on her Galaxy smartphone - provided to her by official Oscar's sponsor Samsung . Indeed, while the selfie featuring . Kevin Spacey, Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt and Jennifer Lawrence taken on . her Samsung Galaxy Note 3 phone was an undoubted success, the gloss was . rubbed off when DeGeneres posted photos online from her iPhone, such as . one selfie with actor Channing Tatum. The . two-time host was rumbled because the source of the photograph as . posted to Twitter can not be seen on their own page, but this . information is visible by using a third-party app such as TweetDeck. And in at at least two pictures posted to Twitter by DeGeneres, the source was revealed to be her  iPhone. To make matters worse for Samsung, the South Korean firm was also ABC's 'The Oscars Backstage' sponsor, which called for a series of 10 promoted tweets of celebrity selfies to be posted online during the ceremony. However, . while Samsung have not responded publicly yet to the mild embarrassment . of DeGeneres' mix-and-matching of smartphones, they still have the huge . publicity that the A-list selfie generated as it was re-tweeted almost 3 . million times and crashed Twitter. 'Samsung's unique product placement, woven into the moment, front and center, without seeming ham-handed, generated the type of positive buzz that is rarely seen and is actually hard to buy,\" said Ammiel Kamon, EVP of products and marketing for Kontera, a prominent social media data tracker. 'Kudos to Ellen for pulling it off,' said Kamon to USA Today. Ellen isn't the first celebrity to have her choice of smartphone questioned. Singer Alicia Keys was called out for tweets sent via iPhone after she had been named Global Creative Director for smartphone maker BlackBerry. But she blamed the incident of hackers. Whoops: While Samsung would have thought their PR victory was complete with the selfie - backstage Ellen was posting pictures to Twitter taken on her iPhone . And . despite their huge presence at the Oscar's during which they launched a . whole new range of products including their new Galaxy S5 smartphone, . Samasung have denied they had paid DeGeneres or ABC any money or . engineered the celebrity-packed selfie. The . South Korean firm did admit to 'an integration with ABC' but the firm . said that it was DeGeneres who chose to 'organically incorporate the . device into the selfie moment that had everyone talking.' In . addition, Samsung said it would be donating $1.5 million each to two of . 'Ellen’s charities of choice,' namely St. Jude’s and the Humane . Society. But in a move . which seemed to confirm at least some kind of publicity tie-in, Samsung . and DeGeneres gifted her audience all a Galaxy smartphone as she . presented her show today. On Sunday night DeGeneres repeatedly brandished her Galaxy during the ceremony she . hosted - taking selfies of stars such as Oscar winner Lizi Minnelli, . which she posted online. The . impromptu and now iconic selfie, which DeGeneres claimed was not . intended, set the record for the most retweeted post ever and even . temporarily disrupted Twitter's service.

'We crashed and broke Twitter,' DeGeneres said later from the stage. 'We made history.' Twitter declined to comment on the service glitches except for a statement on its status blog according to the LA Times: . 'Between . 19:05 and 19:29 PST today, some users may have experienced issues . viewing and sending tweets on twitter.com and Twitter’s mobile apps. 'Traffic was redirected away from the components that were experiencing problems, and the issue has now been resolved.' However, . Twitter did send a congratulatory tweet to DeGeneres remarking, 'The . envelope  please … to @TheEllenShow -- this is now the most retweeted . tweet with over 1 million RTs. Congrats!' Ellen's Samsung use was designed to highlight its new range of products including the Galaxy Note Pro tablet, the Galaxy S5 phone, the Gear 2 smartwatch and a curved ultra-high-definition TV. As part of a deal with broadcast network, ABC, Samsung also sponsored 10 tweets from Ellen featuring selfies in the backstage green room and posted onto the account of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences. However, DeGeneres seems to have posted 4 out of her ten from her iPhone, not her Samsung Galaxy S5 which operates the Android platform. Crash: DeGeneres' tweet even knocked Twitter offline for a bit, racking up more than 700,000 retweets and nearly 200,000 favorites in just 30 minutes. Let me in: The selfie was not planned by Ellen to unfold this way - it was meant to be a quick joke at the expense of Meryl Streep and quickly became something else entirely . Can we get everyone in? Ellen originally wanted to take a selfie with Meryl Streep and crop her head off in the picture . It seems though, that one thing DeGeneres was sure of crashing Twitter in the wake of her sensational selfie. 'I thought it would crash,' DeGeneres told E!'s Marc Malkin at the Governors Ball. 'But I didn't know everyone would do it.' The comedienne told EOnline.Com. 'What's funny is that Lupita's brother is the most prominent. And then Jared came running over to be in it. And Angie got it in. I didn't expect all that.' Indeed, DeGeneres even revealed that she originally wanted to do a visual joke with the selfie by taking the picture and cropping Meryl Streep's head from it. 'That was going to be the joke,' she revealed. 'But it doesn't matter. It was just great.'"}
{"prompt": "Nursery costs have soared by 30 per cent in three years, almost five times faster than average wages. Labour leader Ed Miliband warned many parents are now ‘struggling to cope’ and rising costs mean they spend much of the week working just to cover childcare bills.. He called for a new levy on banks to fund extra childcare for three- and four-year-olds, in the latest assault on the government over the cost of living. Nonsense: Mr Miliband said it was ridiculous that some parents spent most of the week working just to pay for childcare costs . In 2010 the average cost of a nursery place for a child aged two or over for 25-hours-a-week was £82. But . this year it has hit £107, while average weekly earnings have only . risen 6 per cent from £449 to £477 over the last three years. It is adding to the pressure on family finances, with energy bills due to rise by up to 10 per cent this winter. Mr Miliband accused the coalition Government of doing ‘nothing to help’ families and has added stress to family life. On a visit to a nursery today, Mr Miliband said: ‘Millions of parents are facing a childcare crunch. The cost of a nursery place is now the highest in history, at more than £100 a week to cover part-time hours. ‘And average costs for a full-time place are now rising up to £200 or even more. ‘That means a typical parent doing a part-time job would have to work from Monday until Thursday just to cover these costs of childcare. ‘Rising prices have been matched only by falling numbers of places.’ He added: ‘The Tories say they care about families but they have done nothing to help for three years while all the time adding to the stress and strain of family life. ‘If it's bad for families, it's bad for Britain too. Parents who want to work should be able to do so. We need to use the talents of everyone if we are to succeed as an economy and keep social security bills down.’ Ed Miliband met nursery manager Carol Yala-Hutchinson and three year old Alvise  Cocquio during the visit to promote his policy to offer more free childcare . Labour leader Ed Miliband was today forced to deny thinking his shadow chancellor Ed Balls is a 'nightmare' to work with. Leaked emails reveal how the pair are deeply divided over how to respond to the economic revival. They suggested the leader is sick and tired of the shadow chancellor’s refusal to obey his orders and ‘stay on message’. But today Mr Miliband denied a rift, telling ITV's Daybreak: 'It’s fair to say that people send silly emails in offices and this was one of them. 'Ed and I are working really well together, I’m really proud to have him as the Shadow Chancellor working alongside me. 'He’s somebody who I think has been right in his criticism of the Government’s economic policy and he’s also leading the way on this cost of living crisis that we’ve been talking about. So, as I say, people send silly emails in offices but that’s all it is.' Labour accused the government of overseeing the closure of 576 fewer Sure Start centres since the last general election, removing childcare places. But the Department for Education disputed the figures, claiming only 45 Sure Start centres have shut down since 2010 and new ones have opened with a record number of parents using them. In September Mr Miliband unveiled Labour's childcare policy, including an extension of free childcare for three and four-year-olds from 15 to 25 hours a week for working parents. Today the Labour leader said big banks should pay for the extra help for parents. It would be the equivalent of about £1,500 a year saving for families, he said. ‘Childcare costs... are just going up and up and up and parents are really struggling to cope,’ he told ITV's Daybreak. ‘The banks are actually making very big profits and I think they can afford a bit more to help families,’ he said. ‘It's one of those things that is going to be good for the country, because not every parent is going to want to work... but seven out of 10 mums are saying “I want to go back to work but I can't because of the cost of childcare”. ‘They're going to have to work all week to pay for their childcare costs and that's just a nonsense.’ Harriet Waldegrave, Education Fellow at Policy Exchange said: 'Families from all backgrounds face rising childcare costs. However, in a time of stretched budgets, supporting high quality care for children from deprived backgrounds offers greater value for money than subsidies to the richest parents. 'That’s why parents earning as much as £150,000 a year should have their tax-free childcare entitlement cut with the savings of up to £238m used to improve the quality of childcare in the poorest areas of the country.'"}

The Royal Navy engineer is sailing as part of Britain's ebola task force . Naval airman Blango said: ‘This is personal now and the deaths in my family have made me even more determined to help people suffering with ebola. ‘Even my commander asked me not to go because of my family circumstances but I still wanted to go and help. I am proud to do my part and to contribute to the vital humanitarian work. ‘I was aware of the ebola situation in Sierra Leone but it never occurred to me it would affect my own family. I was prepared to go before I knew that my family was involved but knowing that has made me even more determined. ‘I just want to help, not only because of my family, although that has made me more passionate.’ At sea: RFA Argus is expected to remain in Sierra Leone for six months, where it will deliver food and medical supplies to remote areas of the country . He told his father: ‘Somebody has got to do something about it and I’m very pleased we have decided to provide aid. Sierra Leone does not have the infrastructure needed to cope and it would be a disaster for the country if we didn’t help. It is an honour for me to play a part.’ Blango joined the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) in 2009 after obtaining an engineering degree from the University of Greenwich. He is currently sailing to Sierra Leone aboard British hospital ship RFA Argus. His job on board is to service and maintain three Merlin helicopters which, once the vessel arrives off the coast of the country’s capital Freetown this week, will deliver food and medical supplies to remote areas. Blango was able to speak to his parents from Gibraltar last week while the ship docked to allow vehicles to be driven aboard. He told his father, Columba, that he was in a good mood after being granted shore leave and finding a McDonald’s restaurant near the docks. Last night 58-year-old Columba Blango, a former Mayor of Southwark, in South East London, said: ‘Christian joined the Royal Navy for the purpose of humanity. ‘He loves it and he knows he is doing the right thing now, and he considered it his duty to serve his nation. ‘His mother and I are very proud of him. When we’ve spoken to him we’ve tried not to ask him too much about his ebola mission but he seems very positive about what he’s doing. After the terrible family news I was surprised he was emotionally ready to go but he is and I am encouraging him every step of the way.’ Christian Blango was born and raised in Britain but visited his extended family in Sierra Leone as a 17-year-old. On September 11, three of his cousins living in the village of Moyamba Junction, situated 100 miles east of Freetown, began displaying symptoms of the virus. The following day rescue workers from the charity Medecins Sans Frontieres took swabs which led to them being diagnosed with ebola. They subsequently died.

Of these, three have died and six are receiving medical treatment. The 28,000-ton RFA Argus set sail for Sierra Leone ten days ago. Once she arrives, she is likely to spend up to six months there. Last night, the Ministry of Defence declined to comment. More than 10,000 people have been infected with ebola, according to figures released yesterday by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Of those, 4,922 people have died, the WHO said. The ebola epidemic in West Africa is the largest ever outbreak of the disease with a rapidly rising death toll in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. There have also been cases in three other West African countries, Spain and the United States. The UN health agency said yesterday the number of confirmed, probable and suspected cases has risen to 10,141, with about 200 new cases since the last report, four days ago. But even those figures are likely to be an underestimate, the WHO has warned, as many in the hardest hit countries have been unable, or too frightened, to seek medical care. A shortage of labs capable of handling potentially infected blood samples has also made the virus hard to track. It comes as authorities in Mali confirmed the death of the country’s first ebola patient, a two-year-old girl who had arrived from Guinea. And the governors of New Jersey and New York have ordered a mandatory, 21-day quarantine of all medical workers and other arriving airline passengers who have had contact with victims in West Africa."}

Prince Charles' charity for deprived youngsters is axing up to 100 jobs to save on administration costs. The move comes after The Prince's Trust suffered a £2.8million funding shortfall last year which forced it to dig into its reserves. Chief executive Martina Milburn said the Prince of Wales, who founded the charity in 1976 and is still its president, was 'well aware' of the proposed cuts and had backed them to focus on the front line. All 1,300 of the charity's staff are being consulted on the redundancies, which are mostly expected to happen at the charity’s London headquarters. Ms Milburn told BBC Radio 4's The World At One: 'Our head office has become a little too complicated and a bit too top heavy so we are basically slimming down head office and protecting our frontline delivery in order to get ourselves back to sort of break-even budget. 'We are looking at how, as a charity, our admin costs are as low as possible and our money going directly to young people is as much as possible. 'We are currently undergoing a period of consultation but we think it will be between 50 and 100 jobs so we will be going down from 1,300 to about 1,200.' Ms Milburn said the heir to the throne was 'very well aware' of the use of reserve funds and of the move to slim down the staff. 'We felt it was very important to invest in young people in the recession,' she said. 'We have the reserves in the bank to do that and the trustees took the view, along with the executive, that reserves are there for a rainy day and that for young people all around the United Kingdom it was certainly raining. 'The Prince understands basic finances and how you need to make sure that you spend as small amount as you can on administration when you are a charity.' A spokesman said the staff cuts may affect one 'small' element of the trust’s work with young people, but she could not confirm what that element would be because the plans are still out to consultation. However, she said: 'We expect the number of young people we help to remain broadly the same.' President: Prince Charles on a visit to a Prince's Trust centre in Dundee last year. It helps thousands of youths . The trust still has £22 million in reserves and is not in debt, she added. The Prince's Trust was founded to help 13 to 30-year-olds who are unemployed or have dropped out of school. It now has centres throughout Britain which offer enterprise courses, team challenges for people lacking social skills and cash grants of up to £500. The charity has more than 6,000 volunteers and helped a record 55,801 young people in 2012/13, up almost 2,000 on the year before and almost 10,000 on 2010/11. In that time its income rocketed from £40million to £58million - but so did its spending. The charity, whose top executive is paid almost £150,000, spent £80,000 more than it earned in 2012-13. The amount of ready cash it held also dropped by more than £2million in a year."}

The NHS rationing body is refusing to give men with prostate cancer a drug that can delay the need for chemotherapy. Abiraterone, a pill that gives at least four months of extra life, is given to patients after chemo, when they are running out of options. But thousands could benefit from taking it earlier, since it has fewer side effects than chemotherapy and improves quality of life. The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (Nice) today says in final draft guidance that it will not approve such use on the NHS. Campaigners and doctors have condemned the decision, saying it is another example of Nice limiting treatment options for cancer sufferers. They fear that innovative treatments in the pipeline don’t stand a chance of getting approved under the rationing system, and that promised changes next year will actually worsen the situation. They also claim it is ‘illogical’ to prevent men being treated with abiraterone earlier in the disease, when the NHS is already picking up the bill for treatment after chemotherapy. Owen Sharp, Chief Executive of Prostate Cancer UK said ‘It’s a fiasco. This decision is a kick in the teeth for men with advanced prostate cancer. ‘For many this presented a vital opportunity for extra time with loved ones and a chance to delay chemotherapy and the debilitating side effects which come with it.’ Hugh Gunn, treasurer of the prostate cancer charity Tackle, added: ‘We’re so distraught that NICE keep limiting these life saving drugs for men with no other life lines, with seemingly no evidence to support their decisions.’ Doctors at the Institute of Cancer . Research in London, where the drug was discovered, said the decision . showed the system operated by Nice was not fit for purpose – the same . charge made last week when the breast cancer drug Kadcyla was blocked. Angry: Thousands of patients could benefit from taking the drug earlier, but the Nice says it will not approve such use on the NHS. Owen Sharp (pictured), of Prostate Cancer UK, described it as a 'kick in the teeth' In the case of abiraterone, Nice said the drug was too costly to use at an earlier stage in the disease. When the drug is used after chemotherapy, different rules apply that take into account the end-of-life plight of patients which make the drug cost-effective. Although the drug is sold to the NHS at the same price at whatever stage in the disease it is used, the cost effectiveness formula becomes more expensive before chemotherapy. The official price of a month’s treatment is £3,000 but the NHS pays less through a discount scheme from the manufacturer. Professor Paul Workman, Interim Chief . Executive of The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said: . ‘Abiraterone, which was discovered at The Institute of Cancer Research, . is now used as standard after chemotherapy, where it was found to be . cost-effective under NICE’s own end-of-life criteria. Deadly disease: Abiraterone, also known as Zytiga, was used pre-chemotherapy by 3,000 men last year through the Cancer Drugs Fund, which picks up the bill for patients in England. Above, prostate cancer cells . ‘It is plainly illogical that NICE did not have the flexibility to assess use of abiraterone before chemotherapy under the same end-of-life criteria, simply because men were here surviving for longer than the two-year cut-off. ‘It is an unintended, and quite bizarre, consequence of the current rules for appraisals that patients have to wait until their life expectancy drops before they can access beneficial drugs on the NHS. ‘Now men will have to wait until they are in the final stage of their lives before they can access this treatment, and men who are too frail to receive chemotherapy face not being able to receive abiraterone at all.’ Abiraterone, also known as Zytiga, was used pre-chemotherapy by 3,000 men last year through the Cancer Drugs Fund, which picks up the bill for patients in England when a drug is awaiting approval from Nice. Some Britons have survived on it for almost five years. Blocked: Doctors at the Institute of Cancer Research said Nice's decision showed its system was not fit for purpose - the same charge made last week when the breast cancer drug Kadcyla was blocked . Mr Sharp added: ‘The current system is flawed. It is not fit for purpose and it is the very people it is supposed to serve who are bearing the brunt. ‘This decision is unjust and it needs to be overturned so that men in desperate need can receive the most effective drugs, wherever they live.’ Professor Workman said there was mounting concern that British patients would increasingly lose out. ‘We believe that the current Nice system for drug appraisals takes too little account of how innovative a treatment is, and we worry that the new rules under consideration could make this situation even worse,' he said. ‘It is likely that many modern targeted therapies will be more effective in patients when used earlier in treatment or in combinations, but it will be impossible to provide treatment in these ways if innovative drugs first fail to clear the hurdle of Nice approval.’ Dr Peter Barnes, Medical Director at Janssen said the company would appeal. ‘We are very disappointed with this decision which, if it stands, will leave thousands of men in England in the advanced stages of prostate cancer with no option but to accept chemotherapy - which they may not necessarily need or want yet - before being eligible to receive abiraterone routinely on the NHS,' he said. ‘These men will eventually be able to receive abiraterone on the NHS after chemotherapy anyway, but will be denied the option of taking it earlier on in their illness.’ In 2012, Nice attempted to ban the use of abiraterone altogether but was forced into a U-turn after a public outcry and a rare intervention from the Department of Health (DH). In June, former Health Minister Paul Burstow urged the DH to intervene to call off the restriction on pre-chemotherapy use of abiraterone. Sir Andrew Dillon, NICE chief executive, said ‘We know how important it is for patients to have the option to delay chemotherapy and its associated side effects, so we are disappointed not to be able to recommend abiraterone for use in this way. ‘However, it was clear that the drug is not cost effective at its current price.’"}
{"prompt": "(CNN)Want to get a head start on your teen's reading list -- or find new titles to feed your young adult fiction habit? While many recognize the Newbery and Caldecott awards for the year's best children's books, the seventh annual Morris Award celebrates debut books published in 2014 by promising first-time authors in young adult literature. It puts fresh, diverse choices in front of parents, teachers, librarians and teens, while spotlighting titles that might get lost during heavy publishing seasons, like offerings from small press. Previous winners have included authors like John Corey Whaley for his book \"Where Things Come Back.\" But it's not just the winner who benefits -- finalists Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl, nominated for their book \"Beautiful Creatures,\" have also become favorites in the young adult fiction community. Their book also became a film in 2013. \"The Morris Award committee wants a distinct voice that takes readers to new places,\" said Chris Shoemaker, president of the Young Adult Library Services Association. \"They have exemplary voice, as well as strong world-building and character development.\" Here are the five finalists: . \"The Carnival at Bray\" by Jessie Ann Foley . Love, loss and '90s grunge music collide in this story of leaving what you know behind. After 16-year-old Maggie Lynch moves from Chicago to Bray, a small town in Ireland, she experiences her first love and a family tragedy at the same time. Foley, a Chicago Public School teacher, drew on personal experience visiting Bray in 2010 and set the story during the 1990s to include Nirvana as a relatable thread throughout the novel. Teens can relate to the way the characters connect through music, Angie Manfredi, former Morris Award committee member and head of youth services for the Los Alamos County Library System in New Mexico, told CNN. Including Nirvana and the band's late lead singer Kurt Cobain ties in with the theme that nothing can last, creating a \"bittersweet urgency\" in the novel, she said. \"Gabi, a Girl in Pieces\" by Isabel Quintero . In Quintero's semi-autobiographical tale, high school senior Gabi Hernandez tries to figure out her place in her Latino community and her collegiate future. Her eventful senior year is told through lyrical, humorous and brutally honest diary entries about one best friend who is pregnant, another who just came out as gay and a father trying to quit his meth addiction. Quintero, a community college teacher from the Inland Empire of Southern California, wanted to reinforce that young women should feel empowered to make their own life choices, rather than simply live up to societal expectations based on gender or patriarchy: \"There is not just one true experience for everyone -- not as an American, not as a woman, not as a Mexican-American, and I felt like this was a story that needed to be told,\" Quintero told CNN. \"It's a stunning, first-person narrative from this character with a crazy life,\" Teri Lesesne, a professor and former Morris Award committee chairwoman, told CNN. \"She's a good student who doesn't want to fall in love and lose herself. From the realistic voice to the rhythms of her language -- I felt like I knew her.\" \"The Strange and Beautiful Sorrows of Ava Lavender\" by Leslye Walton . Magic and history weave together this multigenerational tale. Ava Lavender is a perfectly normal teenage girl, except for two things: Her family tree is full of doomed love that threatens to repeat itself, and she was born with the wings of a bird. Ava must look to the past in order to navigate her future, especially when she encounters the vastly different ways one can love and be loved at 16. Walton, a teacher and self-described collector of oddities, has always kept a notebook of intriguing moments, facts, scenes and names. Rather than paint a picture of a \"freak\" defined by her oddities, Walton wanted to tell a story that related being odd and strange to being very human. This tale of magic realism is reminiscent of how teenagers visualize their life experiences, Manfredi said. It's a hero's journey that follows a character trying to figure out who she's going to be through poetic storytelling, she added. \"The Scar Boys\" by Len Vlahos . Bullies tied Harbinger Jones to a tree when he was 8 and he was struck by lightning, leaving him scarred for life. As a teen, he makes a friend, forms a punk band and people finally notice him for something other than his scars. When the band goes on tour, his life changes forever. Drawing on his personal experience of dropping out of NYU film school to tour with a punk-pop band called Woofing Cookies, Vlahos connected all of the dots when he came up with the Harbinger character. \"That idea, of a teenage punk band touring America in a dysfunctional van, was a story I always wanted to tell,\" he said. \"The book is really about the complexity of friendships, and the power of music to heal all.\" \"You meet that character and you learn about his scars and how he deals with how he looks -- this thought that 'I'll make fun of me before anyone else does,'\" Lesesne said.  She also said that the story's power is rooted in this emotion and how it utilizes music. \"The Story of Owen: Dragon Slayer of Trondheim\" by E.K. Johnston . In this alternate reality, dragons are everywhere and only dragon-slayers can combat them. When his renowned dragon-slayer aunt retires, Owen learns to continue her legacy. The story is narrated by Owen's tutor, the young, musically inclined Siobhan, who soon discovers her destiny as his bard. Johnston, a forensic archaeologist from Seaforth, Ontario, wanted to tell a story about a dragon slayer and a musician \"and make it as Canadian as possible.\" \"There is so much wonderful humor here, balanced with a lot of action,\" Lesesne said. \"It's a fresh take on heroism and what it means to be a hero. That book is pulled off so beautifully.\""}

Hot topic: Clinton¿s popularity ratings among Democrats and the broader electorate are soaring as talks of her potential run for president fuel further speculation on whether or not she will . The two also lead Women Count, a political action committee that sponsored ads fighting against calls for Clinton to resign early from the 2008 presidential race against Barack Obama. Black and Beck’s group plans to roll out a website for their ‘Ready for Hillary’ PAC in the upcoming weeks, they said. ‘This is not our first campaign. We know how to raise money. Most of us who are involved have done fundraisers before,’ Black told the Hill. ‘I certainly have had fundraisers for her at my house in Virginia. We're there to mobilize support for her in a variety of forms, both financial and grassroots. We're getting ready so that when she's ready, we've got the resources to help her do it.’ The duo said that about a dozen veterans of the 2008 Clinton presidential campaign were involved with their newly formed group.

Stephen and Kirsty Tomlinson and their two children were given barely a month to get off the North Atlantic island after his workplace burned down. Now the couple have swapped sandy beaches and sunshine for concrete and drizzle after returning to Mr Tomlinson’s home town of Hull, east Yorkshire. They were ordered to leave despite their daughter Holly, 12 and son Joseph, six, being born in Bermuda. Dream over: Stephen Tomlinson, with his wife Kirsty and children Holly, 12, and and Joseph, six, near their new home in Hull.  The couple were ordered leave Bermuda last month after Mr Tomlinson's business burned down . Mr Tomlinson had worked as a spray painter, while his 41-year-old wife ran a beauty therapy business and had clients including Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas. Mr Tomlinson, 45, said: ‘My daughter is crying herself to sleep at night and the kids ask ‘When are we going home, Daddy?’ Bermuda is the oldest of Britain's Overseas Territories. Its Parliament first met in 1620, making it the oldest Commonwealth legislature outside the British Isles. Though Bermuda exercises a great deal of autonomy over its own affairs, the UK Government remains responsible for its external relations, defence and internal security. The question remains of whether the territory should cut its links with Britain, but the last time a referendum was held - in 1995 - only a quarter of the 58 per cent turnout voted for independence.Its current government, led by premier Paula Cox and her Progressive Labour Party, is in favour of independence - but the most recent opinion polls have consistently shown large majorities against it. ‘I don’t understand how they could do this to us after we’d been there so long. We had to sell all our belongings and get out, despite having worked hard and paid our way.’ Stephen had friends fight for their right to stay but the Bermudan Government refused to be swayed. He fears more ex-pats could be ordered to leave Bermuda as its government tightens up immigration and has called on the Foreign Office to intervene . While Bermuda has granted permanent residency to Britons living on the island since 1989, the couple missed the cut-off point by just two years. In 2010, the Government announced it would make it harder to gain and renew work permits in a bid to boost employment among citizens of the island. Only highly-trained foreigners with particular skills are being granted work permits. Painters and beauticians are among occupations that are among those professions that are 'proscribed'. The territory has even provided tax relief to those . firms who employ previously jobless Bermudans, who accuse British and . other immigrants of marginalising them. The Foreign Office says it is unable to stop the island’s Government forcing Britons to give up their jobs and sending them back to the UK. Mr Tomlinson said: ‘There are still people from Hull out there and more Britons will be sent home. You build a life up only to get kicked out.' Happier times: The Tomlinsons and their children playing on the beach near their former home in Bermuda . Idyllic: The family sit beside a plam tree near their cottage on the paradise island in the North Atlantic . Bad tidings: The letter the Tomlinsons were sent by the Bermudan government that gave them less than a months to settle up and leave . He was 24 when he moved to the group of islands in the North Atlantic Ocean from Garden Village in east Hull in 1991. He met Kirsty, of Goole, who was also on a work permit and the two later married. Mrs Tomlinson said: ‘Stephen’s heart was in Bermuda and it is a lovely country. ‘My roots are in England and I class it as my home but I’ve learnt so much on the island.’ The couple’s dream life came crashing down when Stephen’s place of work burnt to the ground last year. Mr Tomlinson said: ‘We were all made redundant but the local paper ran a story saying people were prepared to help us find work. ‘Luckily, I still had job offer and I decided to take work at a Mercedes dealership.I applied for my annual work permit and it was declined. ‘We didn’t know what to do and everyone said it would be sorted but it wasn’t.’ Stephen was sent a letter from the Department of Immigration, which advised him to settle his affairs, giving him a deadline of less than a month to leave the island. The letter stated: ‘The Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry, after having reviewed the request, has refused the application. 'You are now being advised to settle your affairs, together with your family and leave Bermuda.’ The family are being backed by Conservative MP Andrew Percy, who is vowing to take their case to ministers. However, they know it is very unlikely they will be able to return. Mr Percy said: ‘Although Bermuda is a British colony, it has control over its own immigration system. ‘It’s completely unjust that the Tomlinson family should be cheated in this way when they have lived there for so long. I will do everything I can to help them.’ Population: 64,000 . By the sea: Tourists flock to pink sands and snorkel through clear blue waters packed with wrecks and reefs .

People with depression were 3.24 times more likely to develop the disease than those without the mental health problem, said the researchers writing online in the journal Neurology.

Sina's Weibo and Tencent's QQ -- Chinese versions of Twitter, which is banned in the mainland -- will stop use of comment function on the popular sites to \"clean up rumors and other illegal information spread through microbloggings,\" according to Xinhua. The comments sections will be disabled until Tuesday. The microblog sites have been \"criticized and punished accordingly\" by officials in Beijing and Guangdong, state media reported. Authorities also closed 16 websites and detained six people, Xinhua reported, for allegedly spreading rumors of \"military vehicles entering Beijing and something wrong going on in Beijing,\" a spokesperson for the State Internet Information Office told Xinhua. An unknown number of people who also reported rumors were \"admonished and educated\" but \"have shown intention to repent,\" Beijing police told state media. China's Internet was rife with rumors of an alleged coup attempt last week after the shock dismissal Communist Party politburo member and Chongqing party chief Bo Xilai earlier in the month. Cyberspace discussions on Bo's fate have been censored. On Weibo last week, bloggers who type in Bo's name, or even his initials BXL and homophones, typically got an automatic reply: \"Due to relevant regulations and policies, search results for 'Bo Xilai' are not being displayed.\" China's censors fuel online frenzy . Zhang Zhi An, an associate professor of journalism at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, says the government's actions are \"not surprising.\" \"The government worries the information could have some mobilization functions, that it will make people worried about the stability of society,\" said Zhang who was attending a conference on microblog activism at Fudan University in Shanghai on Saturday. \"The information that was posted hints that there is a very big struggle in the Central Party, and I think the Party can not accept this information. \"This is a very clear sign to netizens that they must be responsible for their posts online,\" Zhang said. \"If it is not true, if it is fake, if it comes from your imagination, we will take actions to punish you.\" This is the second time the government has taken serious action against China's microblogs, according to Zhang. The first time occurred in 2009 when dozens of Twitter-like sites were simply closed by the government. Since then, two main players have emerged in the market - Sina Weibo and Tencent's QQ. The platforms have experienced explosive growth in recent years and in many ways have become alternative information sources for the country's 500 million internet users who post information that is not reported in China's state-controlled media. Yet the platforms have been a source of ongoing concern for officials who fear that they could be used to mobilize protests or other movements that could jeopardize social stability, Zhang said. In an effort to try to prevent the spreading of rumors or other information deemed sensitive or inaccurate, the government recently implemented a policy requiring all microblog users to register their accounts using their real names. Sina Weibo and other micro blogging platforms were supposed to have implemented the real-name registration policy by March 16.

In addition to the deaths, 18 others were injured at the October 8 event at Angel Valley Retreat Center near Sedona, Arizona. The latest victim, Lizabeth Neuman, 49, was a Minnesota mother of three. She died at the Flagstaff Medical Center, the Yavapai County Sheriff's Office said. There were up to 65 visitors, ages 30 to 60, at the resort attending the \"Spiritual Warrior\" program by self-help expert James Arthur Ray, according to authorities. Participants spent up to two hours inside the sweatbox, a dome-like structure covered with tarps and blankets, the sheriff's office said. Hot rocks and water are used to create steam in the enclosed environment. Neuman's attorney, Lou Diesel, told CNN her family is cooperating with the investigation and once it's complete, he will \"take all the appropriate actions in response to those responsible for Liz's death.\" Fire and rescue officials received an emergency call from the resort and transported the injured by air and land ambulances to nearby medical facilities, the sheriff's office said. Two people were pronounced dead shortly after arrival at a local medical center. A homicide investigation into the incident is under way, authorities said. The other retreat participants who were hospitalized have since been released. Ray is widely known for programs that claim to teach individuals how to create wealth from all aspects of their lives -- financially, mentally, physically and spiritually. He has appeared on various national programs, including CNN's \"Larry King Live.\" CNN's Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report."}

Two adult beavers, one juvenile and the three young, known as kits, are now believed to be living in the River Otter in Devon. The beavers were originally found to be living in the east Devon river in July last year when dog walker Lorna Douglas, 35, spotted one swimming around. Scroll down for video . Two adult beavers, one juvenile and three young - known as kits - are now believed to be living on the River Otter in Devon. Two adult beavers were first spotted in the river in July last year by dogwalker Lorna Douglas . After being spotted last year, retired environmental scientist Tom Buckley set up three infra-red cameras to film the beavers, which led to the recent discovery that one had given birth to three young (above) Following the sighting, retired environmental scientist Tom Buckley set up three infra-red cameras – which take photographs when they sense movement – along a stretch of the river. He has caught them on camera several times since January and they have been filmed grooming themselves, gnawing at the base of trees and happily playing together. The government had originally said the beavers would be rehomed, as they could be carrying a disease, but wildlife campaigners now hope to get permission for them to stay. Mr Buckley, who discovered the beavers had mated after spotting the young on his latest footage, said: ‘I was so excited to see the female and the kit. It's fantastic stuff. ‘Our baby beavers have been born free and their freedom should not be taken away by imprisoning them in a zoo. ‘I'd be extremely disappointed if the government did that.’ Devon Wildlife Trust said it was working to get a licence from Natural England for the ‘non-native species’ to remain on the river. Campaigners are trying to get a licence from Natural England for the 'non-native species' to stay on the river . Experts think the beavers most likely escaped from a private collection, rather than being released deliberately . Sightings of the animals in the River Otter were believed to be the first of their kind for 800 years. Their presence suggests that beavers may be breeding outside captivity for the first time in centuries. Beavers were once common throughout Britain but were hunted to extinction in England and Wales 800 years ago due to their highly valued fur, meat and for castoreum – a secretion of the animal’s scent gland which was used as a headache cure. The ast few British beavers were hunted to extinction during the 16th century. To return the creatures to the UK, conservationists have reintroduced them by using close relatives from Norway. Between May 2009 and September 2010, the Scottish Beaver Trial released four family groups and one pair of beavers into Knapdale Forest, Argyll. More recently, beavers have been reintroduced in captive areas as part of breeding programs including at Ottery St Mary and Gloucestershire - but none are unaccounted for and the River Otter beavers are thought to have escaped from a private collection. They remained in Scotland but disappeared from the UK completely 400 years ago. Experts think the beavers in the River Otter most likely escaped from a private collection, rather than being released deliberately. The Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs said the government was taking ‘precautionary actions’ amid fears the animals could be carrying a disease ‘not currently present in the UK’. ‘We are taking precautionary action by testing the beavers,’ a spokesman said. ‘This will be done with their welfare in mind.’ He added the department would wait until the kits were a suitable age before testing them for disease. There are two species of beaver - the European and North American. Lorna Douglas first spotted the wild beaver in the River Otter last July and managed to take a photo (above) In recent months, the beavers have been filmed grooming . themselves, gnawing trees and playing together . The adult beavers and their young have been living beside the River Otter in Devon since at least July last year . The European is considered ‘vulnerable’ and is extinct in most of Western Europe, with around 700,000 living in the wild in territories stretching from Eastern Europe to the Chinese and Mongolian borders. There were several attempts to breed American and European beavers to boost numbers of the European species, until scientists realised they are genetically incompatible. Conservationists have since introduced several small groups of beavers back into captivity in the UK, but this is thought to be the first group found living in the wild."}

The parents of a murdered Auburn University student from suburban Atlanta said they’ve filed an official claim against the school. Lauren Burk’s family believe she might still be alive if the school had a campus police department. Burk, 18, a graduate of Walton High School in Marietta, Georgia, was abducted from a campus parking lot and killed in March 2008. Courtney Lockhart, a 23-year-old Iraq War veteran, was convicted in her murder in 2010 and was sentenced to death. Scroll down for video . Life cut short: Lauren Burk (left), 18, was kidnapped and shot dead by Iraq War veteran Courtney Lockhart . Terrifying scenario: Burk was snatched from a parking lot on the campus of Auburn University during a robbery attempt . ‘It’s like it happened yesterday,’ Jim Burk told the station WSB-TV of his daughter’s death. ‘There’s not a day that goes by that my family doesn’t have her close in our mind and heart.’ ‘Losing a child is like carrying stones in your pocket at all times,’ said Lauren’s mother, Viviane Guerschon. ‘You get used to the weight, but the weight is always there.’ Police said Lockhart abducted Burk from a parking lot outside an Auburn dorm during a bungled robbery attempt on the night of March 4, 2008. He forced her to take off her clothes so she wouldn't try to escape and drove around, investigators said, trying to decide what to do with her. Lockhart shot Burk in the chest at close range as she jumped from the moving car, police said. She bled to death along the side of the road a short time later. Gruesome end: Burk attempted to escape by jumping out of the car, but Lockhart shot her in the chest and left her bleeding to death on the side of the road . Closure: Lauren Burk's mother Vivian Guerchan is hugged by supporter in the courtroom in Opelika, Alabama, in 2010 as Lockhart is found guilty of the student's slaying . Phoenix City police arrested Lockhart three days later after a car chase sparked by an attempted robbery. Burk’s parents said they think the presence of campus police officers could have prevented the parking lot abduction. Auburn shuttered its police department several years before the killing to save money. Auburn city police patrol the campus. Burk’s parents also said they believe Auburn did not follow security recommendations in a federal report. Auburn cannot be sued because of sovereign immunity laws, WSB-TV reported. Taking a stand: Unable to sue Auburn University because of sovereign immunity laws, Jim Burk (center) and his ex-wife (far right) have filed a $1million claim against the school . Parents' anguish: Lauren's family believe the presence of campus police officers could have prevented her abduction and murder . The Burk family said it has filed a claim seeking $1million against the school with the state’s Board of Adjustment. The board can consider the claim and use state money to compensate cases that it feels have merit. ‘It’s kind of a moral claim, and I want them to be judged by public opinion,’ Mr Burk said. ‘My concern is to make sure that this doesn’t happen to anybody else.’ A spokesman for the university said the university doesn’t comment on pending investigations."}

Hundreds of thousands of offences may not have been documented because police fiddled the figures. Constabularies in England and Wales yesterday reported that the number of crimes fell by 3 per cent last year. But in the Kent force – where figures have been ‘cleaned up’ after a period of manipulation – recorded crime rose by 8 per cent. Picture of Britain: Crime has dropped to the lowest level since 1981 but there are mounting concerns that police have been 'fiddling' figures for years . On the rise: One area where crimes appear to be rising is sexual offences, with experts saying the Jimmy Savile scandal and the 'Yewtree effect' has caused a surge in reports . If the same pattern was repeated across the country nearly 300,000 extra crimes would be reported. In Kent, violent crime was up a fifth and sex offences and robbery by half. Drug . offences were up by 14 per cent, public order offences by 16 per cent . and other ‘miscellaneous’ crimes by a third.

It . showed sharp falls in violence – by 13 per cent – and snatch thefts. Crimes against households fell 10 per cent and bike theft was down 15 . per cent, to its lowest level in a decade. Norman . Baker, Liberal Democrat crime prevention minister, said: ‘England and . Wales are safer than they have been for decades with crime now at its . lowest level since the survey began in 1981. ‘The .

Reports of . fraud – including card theft, online fraud and email scams – rocketed 34 . per cent, to 200,000. This is thought to be due in part to improved . recording techniques.

{"prompt": "(CNN) -- Sentencing testimony begins Wednesday in the case of an Iraqi man who was convicted of running over his 20-year-old daughter because she allegedly had become \"too Westernized.\" A Maricopa County, Arizona, jury convicted Faleh Hassan Almaleki, 50, on Tuesday of second-degree murder in the 2009 death of Noor Faleh Almaleki. It also found him guilty of aggravated assault, for causing serious injuries to Amal Edan Khalaf, the mother of Noor's fiance, and two counts of leaving the scene. Almaleki, an Iraqi immigrant, was acquitted of more serious first-degree murder and first-degree attempted murder charges. He could receive up to 22 years in prison on the murder charge alone. Noor Faleh Almaleki died in November 2009 at an Arizona hospital, nearly two weeks after being run over by a Jeep in a parking lot in the Phoenix suburb of Peoria, authorities said. Faleh Hassan Almaleki believed his daughter had become \"too Westernized\" and had abandoned \"traditional\" Iraqi values, Peoria police said. The family moved to the Phoenix area in the mid-1990s, and Almaleki was unhappy with his daughter's style of dress and her resistance to his rules, they said. Khalaf testified that Almaleki made no effort to stop before she and Noor Almaleki were struck, according to CNN Phoenix affiliate KTVK. Defense lawyers said Almaleki was trying to spit on Khalaf, but swerved and ended up running down both women, KTVK reported. Almaleki chose not to testify. After the incident, Almaleki drove to Mexico, abandoning his vehicle in Nogales, police said. He then made his way to Mexico City and boarded a plane to Britain, where authorities denied him entry into the country and put him on a plane back to the United States.

The space shuttle Discovery is brought by crawler to its pad at Cape Canaveral, Florida, on August 4. Launch is scheduled for 1:36 a.m. ET Tuesday, NASA said. However, launches often are delayed because of inclement weather or technical concerns. Discovery will carry a crew of seven astronauts as it ferries equipment to the space station. One of the astronauts, Nicole Stott, will remain on the space station as a flight engineer, replacing astronaut Timothy Kopra, who will return home aboard Discovery as a mission specialist, according to the NASA Web page for the mission. Discovery will also be carrying the Combined Operational Load Bearing External Resistance Treadmill (COLBERT) to the space station. The treadmill is named for fake newsman Stephen Colbert of Comedy Central's \"The Colbert Report.\" Earlier this year, NASA conducted an online poll to name the space station's newest compartment, asking voters to choose one of four given options or offer their own suggestion. Colbert urged his viewers to suggest \"Colbert,\" which won. But Colbert and the space agency compromised to give the moniker to the treadmill instead. The new module was given the name Tranquility. \"I'm so proud my treadmill will be going into space to help trim down those famously fat astronauts. Lay off the Tang, Chubby!\" Colbert said in a statement.

When Freddy Taylor started waking up and playing loudly during the early hours, his parents hoped it was a phase he would grow out of. Unfortunately that didn’t happen. The three-year-old’s nightly play sessions lasting two hours or more became so exhausting that his sleep-deprived parents resorted to drastic action. After taking expert advice they stripped his bedroom of toys and all colourful objects so his imagination wouldn’t be stimulated when he woke up. Freddy Taylor, 3, wakes up so much in the night that his exhausted parents, Kathryn (pictured) and Ryan, took him to see sleep specialists . The tips his mother Kathryn Taylor, 33, received during recent ‘sleep therapy’ sessions did improve the youngster’s sleeping - especially on the two nights a week after attending pre-school . Mother-of-two Mrs Taylor and her husband Ryan, 36, a computer technician, were at their ‘wits’ end’ after enduring two years of sleep deprivation which started when Freddy was one. She said: ‘He will pretend he’s playing with his friends. He uses the same name as his friends at school, and tells me sometimes that he’s been “in a film” with his friends. ‘It sounds like a dream, but we’ve taken him to a sleep clinic where they observed his patterns and said he is definitely awake when he’s playing. ‘I call it sleep parties because he is really having a great time. He isn’t attention-seeking, in fact if you go in, he doesn’t want to be disturbed in his games.’ Freddy goes to bed at 7pm each night and never has a problem nodding off. He can stay awake for up to four hours a night - although it is usually two or three - and is woken at 7am regardless of what happened at night. They were advised to remove anything colourful from his room as it could stimulate his imagination when he wakes up in the night . As a result his parents get about five hours sleep and luckily his one-year-old brother Morgan is in a separate room and manages to sleep through the noise. ‘Freddy has a very vivid imagination. He can be incredibly loud, so much so that I actually went round next door to apologise when our new neighbours moved in,’ said Mrs Taylor, from Sheffield. The sleep practitioner advised them to remove anything with colour that may catch his eye. ‘We’ve taken down his posters, taken out his toys, that sort of thing. His bedroom is painted a calming green colour already so we haven’t had to redecorate.’ They also now given Freddy an extra evening meal of foods such as bananas, peanut butter and oats which help release the brain’s sleep-inducing chemical melatonin. His parents were also told to put him to bed at 7pm and wake him up at 7am regardless of how much of the night he spends awake . But despite these tactics the battle continues. And the Easter break from school caused the ‘parties’ between 1 and 3am to start again every night. ‘It’s utterly exhausting because Ryan and I are obviously not getting much sleep,’ said Mrs Taylor. ‘And because he’s been up all night, Freddy is often difficult during the day, he’s grumpy or wants to go to sleep, so it’s been really challenging dealing with him.’ The parents hope the situation will improve when Freddy starts school full-time. They were also told to give him foods - such as bananas and oats - before bed because these encourage the brain to release sleep chemicals . Vicki Dawson, Founder of The Children's Sleep Charity, said: ‘We take a behavioural approach to children with sleep problems like Freddy’s, any medical problems we refer them to experts. ‘Structure is essential, parents have to implement the guidance we give them for the therapy to work. ‘We offer dietary advice, recommend setting strict bed times and pre-bedtime activity to calm children down. ‘We also recommend taking items out of bedrooms which will catch a child's attention when they wake up. ‘In the vast majority of cases, parents see improvements. We've collected figures which say 89 per cent of children have improved. ‘The other 11 per cent might be parents who haven't implemented what we've recommended, or a child with a medical issue.’"}

During the day, they charge batteries, allowing the plane to fly through the night . The updated plane presented to the world at the Payerne Air Force Base in Switzerland has better batteries for storing energy soaked up from the sun by the 7,200 solar cells that cover its massive wings. The Swiss team planning to complete the first round-the-world solar flight next year have already demonstrated that a solar-powered plane can fly through the night, between two continents and across the United States. At 72 meters (236 feets) its wingspan is eight meters longer than the first prototype - longer even than the wings of a Boeing 747 jumbo jet - but still only weights 2.3 metric tons (2.54 tons), about as much as a large car. The materials in the updated plane are also lighter than before, it has more efficient electric motors, and a 'good business class seat,' Borschberg said. Because while the journey will be broken up into several stages, the aircraft's slow speed means it will have to stay in the air for several days in a row during the long transoceanic legs. 80 companies contributed cutting-edge technologies to the plane, which is meant to showcase the possibility of using cleaner energy sources. Borschberg said the trip next year would take about 20 flying days, spread over several months. How it works: The developers worked with over 80 hi-tech firms to develop the craft . Solar Impulse is the product of an alliance between two men to fulfill a project deemed impossible by industry experts. While Bertrand Piccard, a psychiatrist and explorer, sourced partners to finance the project and promoted the cause for clean technologies (subsequently endorsed by many political authorities), engineer and entrepreneur André Borschberg brought together and led a technical team of 80. It has taken 12 years of calculations, simulations, construction and testing to arrive at today’s launch of Solar Impulse 2 – the most revolutionary aircraft of out of time, set to fly around the world. The round the world trip, planned for next year would take about 20 flying days, spread over several months. The attempt to make the first round-the-world solar-powered flight is scheduled to start in March 2015 from Gulf area. Solar Impulse will fly, in order, over the Arabian Sea, India, Burma, China, the Pacific Ocean, the United States, the Atlantic Ocean and Southern Europe or North Africa before closing the loop by returning to the departure point. Landings will be made every few days to change pilots and organize public events for governments, schools and universities. 'A vision counts for nothing unless it is backed up by action,' said Bertrand Piccard, founder and Chairman of Solar Impulse. 'With 8 world records for Solar Impulse 1, the first solar aircraft capable of flying during the night, crossing two continents and flying over the United States, we have shown that clean technologies and renewable energies can accomplish the impossible,' 'Now we need to go even further,' added André Borschberg, co-founder and CEO. 'Solar Impulse 2 will have virtually unlimited autonomy, and now we need to make sure the pilot is as sustainable as his aircraft. 'This is why the round-the-world flight will be as much a human as a technological feat.' To complete the round-the-world flight, Solar Impulse 2 will have to accomplish what no other aircraft has achieved before: flying without fuel with only one pilot for 5 consecutive days and nights over oceans from one continent to another. This is the challenge for which the aircraft has been built. There is a 3.8 m3 cockpit, every detail of which has been designed for a pilot to live there for a week. H . However, for the sake of maximum energy efficiency, the cabin is not pressurized or heated – a further endurance challenge for the pilot. Test flights are due to take place in May, followed by training flights over Switzerland. People look at the second Solar Impulse experimental solar-powered plane, the HB-SIB, to be used for a round-the-world voyage next year, during its presentation in Payerne on April 9, 2014. The pilots admitted on improvement since the prototypes was a 'business class' seat for the pilots. The huge aircraft carries just two people, but has a larger wingspan than a Boeing 747 ."}

While the Manchester United squad continue to put in the hard yards ordered by Louis van Gaal, their new manager is clocking up air miles as he works on the next chapter of his distinguished career.

He will spend just two days at home before starting work in Manchester, and another 48 hours in England before United fly to California to start their US tour.

However, the thoughts of the 62-year-old have already turned to his next assignment and the United players have been adhering to his training instructions in his absence. The players were put through two double sessions during their first week back and were then called in for a workout on Sunday. ‘I don’t need a holiday,’ said Van Gaal. ‘It’s great to have such an exciting challenge. To work daily with young people is something I don’t need time off to rest for. I’ve only met two people from the daily management, the chief scout and the chief executive officer. And two of the owners. 'It’s time I got to know more people. I will do my best. Whether that’s enough for the fans, I will wait and see, but I hope that will be the case.' Van Gaal has been credited with bringing unity to a Holland set-up that, historically, has not provided the most harmonious of environments. After a 5-1 win over Spain in the opening game, Holland finished top of Group B and beat Mexico then Costa Rica, on penalties, before losing a shootout to Argentina in the semi-final. Now Van Gaal wants to create a similar spirit at United following a calamitous season under David Moyes. One of the first tasks will be to address the relationship between Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie. Captain material?

{"prompt": "(CNN) -- Long established as the premier portal for sound, your ears are facing increased competition from emerging techniques for transmission through your skeleton. Bone conduction has rapidly become a critical asset for treatment of hearing loss. While a new generation of cochlear implants has had spectacular success in recent years, they rely on air conduction and the patient possessing a functional pathway from outer to inner ear. For patients with severely damaged pathways, such implants offer no solution. Baha (bone anchored hearing aids) units work by passing sound from a microphone to a magnet or implant beneath a patient's skin, which is converted into vibrations in the skull and eventually arrives at the inner ear. This process extends the miracle of restored hearing to victims of such conditions as microtia or atresia, where the ear or canal is closed or deformed. \"It's the natural spectrum of sound compared with traditional hearing\", says Brian Walshe, spokesperson of hearing treatment company Cochlear. \"Even with amplification it's the same, there's no distortion.\" The company recently launched a wireless Baha set, an indication of the technology's progress and growing popularity. Implants have become smaller and less invasive, while cosmetics have improved so that the system can be worn without advertising it. Bone conduction is not a new discovery. Ludwig Van Beethoven overcame deafness by biting a metal rod attached to his piano to hear his work. Neither do they need to be compensation for disability - such systems have been used by military in environments that require awareness as well as audio instructions. A member of the SEAL team which killed Osama Bin Laden wrote in his autobiography that bone conduction communication was critical to co-ordinating the raid. The innovation is beginning to seep into consumer electronics. In the early 2000s, headphone sets appeared that played music via the user's bones, but the systems were hamstrung by high cost and low quality, with common complaints about muffled and distorted sound. The makers of Aftershokz believe they have solved those problems with a unit that retails for $79. \"The difficulty for bone conduction has been transmitting vibrations through bone with enough power for music, you need to be on the 20 - 20,000 Hz frequency range,\" says CEO Bruce Borenstein. \"We have been able to power dual transducers with enough vibration to make the sound musical, which has been our big breakthrough.\" The bone conduction system offers key safety advantages over traditional earphones, by leaving the user's ears free so that they are not distracted from their environment. It is even possible to drive wearing them, as they comply with the legal requirement to be able to hear on the road. The Audiology Foundation of America have also supported the concept, stating that it causes less damage to the ears than ear buds. A flood of competitors are entering the market and innovation is not limited to headphones. Google Glass are using bone conduction rather than ear buds for their speaker system, although there have been teething problems. Multiple patents are emerging for underwater and deep sea communication systems, and the technology has become cheap and accessible enough to be viable for novelty items such as talking pillows. The field has even expanded to offer audio communications through diverse body parts including the teeth and eyes. \"In theory you can hear from anywhere\", says Dr. Sunil Puria, ear biomechanics expert at Stanford University. \"Although practically there would be disruption by having to pass through soft tissue depending on the point of contact.\" The technology has offered a new dimension to advertisers, with BBDO trialling a system on German trains that plays targeted messages to commuters as they lean against the window. The company claim a positive public reaction, and promise the concept will deliver social benefits through delivering announcements and emergency warnings. But the scheme has been controversial, with civil liberty activists arguing it is invasive and delivers content without consent. Dr. Puria foresees another ethical concern. \"As it vibrates your skull to generate sound, others around you can also potentially hear a message sent to you, so there will be privacy issues. That's a problem that needs to be solved.\" But he believes the major technological hurdles have been overcome. \"There has been tremendous progress, from miniaturization, to wearable and wireless, so that we have reached the holy grail of not requiring earphones.\" From medicine to entertainment, from reef diving to sleeping in our beds, we may have to get used to a whole new set of voices in our head.

Married with a child, Pyretta Blaze and Andy Filth (not their real names) from South Wales, say they're just like any other couple, apart from one slight difference -- they like to drink each other's blood. Andy and Pyretta, who appeared on This Morning to encourage more open-mindedness for their lifestyle, are part of the UK's 15,000 strong vampire community. Self-confessed vampire Andy, likened the act of slurping his partners blood to sex and said, 'When you're drinking each others blood you're connected to each others souls.' He said the taste didn't make him feel sick but admitted, 'It's not like strawberries -- it's got a metallic taste.' Scroll down for video . Your friendly vampires next-door: Pyretta Blaze (left) and Andy Filth (right) appeared on ITV's This Morning . Nowadays the couple satisfy their blood cravings in the privacy of their own bedroom, but in their single days they would go out on the prowl, like any other youngsters. 'I used to go to gatherings where the exchange of blood would happen,' explained Pyretta, who was keen to point out that it was safe and nothing for the public to be scared about. She assured viewers that they don't lurk around in the dark and only drink blood in the confines of the vampire community. 'Everyone is completely vetted to check they have no mental health history and have a clean blood record,' she said. 'Everyone has a full examination - mentally and physically.' 'You pick one partner you're totally happy with and it's very safe, clean and sterile.' When Philip then inquired if it was form of sex, she replied, 'Yes, of course! 'We are very health conscious - as you would be when having sex. We are very responsible,' she added. Pyretta (left) used to go to vampire gatherings to get her blood fix before she met Andy (right) But one thing that really gets Pyretta's blood boiling is Hollywood's portrayal of vampires. 'It really makes me mad!' she said. 'People are so misled and easily influenced by things in Hollywood. Interview with two vampires: The couple say they want to change misconceptions about the bloody-thirsty lifestyle . 'I can look into the mirror and do my hair!' she said referring to the myth that if vampires look at their own reflection the mirror cracks. So what actually goes on behind vampires' bedroom doors? 'You can have a ceremonial pin to draw blood,' Andy explained. 'You don't need a lot, just a small dab.' 'I do it from my neck just behind me ear,' he said revealing a tattoo of a vampire bite on the side of his neck. 'And we do try to use same spot every time.' 'It's not cut deep enough to scar. It's not self harm,' Pyretta was quick to add. Pyretta blames Hollywood for the misunderstanding surrounding vampires' scary image (as depicted above) 'The amount of blood you drawer depends on what you eat and drink because that affects blood flow,' he explained. 'But we use whatever comes out -- I wouldn't keep cutting,' he said. Of course, their hobby comes with a health warning and they admitted it's 'enormously dangerous'.'It can't just be done because you feel like it. You have to know what you're doing,' said Andy. 'It's our spiritual connection to each other. We have a child, which makes us as close as we can be. But the next step is to be joined by our souls. But Andy swears his love for Pyretta trumps his vampire lifestyle. 'If one of us wanted to stop, it wouldn't be over,' he said. 'I see it as bonus. It's something we're both into and a big part of our life. But if it was to go away we wouldn't need to find someone else. Also on the programme was psychologist, Dr Emyr Williams, who has been studying the vampires for ten years. 'It's a religion,' he explained. 'It's taken me 6 years to get the trust of the community so I can begin my research. It was very difficult because they are often mocked as society doesn't understand them. 'I've found out that these are normal people. They may need to consume blood and psychic energy - but they may not actually like that about themselves.' You can watch the full interview here ."}
{"prompt": "A grief-stricken father, who lost his wife and newborn twin girls to tuberculosis, spoke for the first time about their deaths and revealed that his wife had never been tested for the disease. Ruben White, 30, is suing Summerlin Hospital Medical Center in Las Vegas over the deaths of his 25-year-old wife Vanessa and daughters Emma and Abigail. Mr White choked up as he talked about the terrible loss of his family on Thursday. He told the Las Vegas Review-Journal: 'I would never . wish this on anyone else. You get the sense that sometimes life is not fair. My hope is that nobody else would have to go through this.' A devastated Ruben White talks about the death of his wife Vanessa and newborn twin daughters at a press conference in Las Vegas on Thursday . Baby Abigail, one of the twins born to Ruben and Vanessa White, is shown in Summerlin Hospital, Las Vegas. She died of tuberculosis in August . Loss: Vanessa White and her newborn babies died after she contracted TB meningitis . The . twin girls were the couple's first children. Mrs White, a dental clerical worker, and her government employee husband had been married for three years at the time of her . death. Mrs White had visited the same ER in Las Vegas three times during her pregnancy with a relentless cough which caused her to bring up mucus, a high fever and delirium. She was never tested for tuberculosis, Mr White said. Mrs White gave birth prematurely in May to twin girls but her health rapidly deteriorated. TB meningitis - rare in the U.S. - is more deadly than other forms of TB. Between 1993 and 2005, the Centers for Disease Control recorded 1,649 new cases of TB meningitis. TBM is passed on through prolonged contact with an infected person. Early symptoms, like fatigue and aches and pains are often missed. Symptoms, such as vomiting, headaches, seizures and an aversion to bright lights, don't appear for several weeks. Treatment can take up to a year but in many cases patients suffer long-lasting effects due to brain-tissue damage. All of the people found to have contracted the infection are being treated with antibiotics. She watched as three-week-old Emma died on June 1 from respiratory problems. Despite rounds of heavy antibiotics, Mrs White, a lifelong member of the Church of Jesus Christ Latter Day Saints, passed away on July 1. It was only when an autopsy was conducted that doctors discovered she had TB. Surviving twin Abigail was quickly diagnosed with TB and placed in isolation but died from the disease a few weeks later. Emma had never been tested for TB. Testing of family, friends and hospital . employees conducted after Mrs White's death in July found 26 people . tested positive for the infection. Two of those had the contagious form, while the rest had inactive TB. Mr White's attorney Robert Cottle said on Thursday: 'There were multiple diagnostic failures. Lives would've been saved had tuberculosis been thought of in May or June.' According to the lawyer, doctors conducted . multiple tests, but didn't pursue the possibility of TB after a nurse . screened for symptoms and ruled out the condition. He added: 'No one connected the dots in this case, and as you can see, the dots were very obvious.' A Nevada Bureau of Health Care investigation found that Summerlin Hospital didn’t take basic precautions to stop the spread of infection - but facility leaders still say they followed protocol, according to the Review-Journal. Mrs White was allowed to visit one of her twins in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit while she had a 103-fever and was not wearing a mask or gown. Mr White said on Thursday: 'We would never want to cause any harm to our babies, so we would have done whatever it took. 'There was nothing ever told to us about anything other than regular washing of your hands when going into the NICU.' The hospital issued a statement expressing sympathy for the family, but saying it took appropriate steps in the case. 'Medical experts who have . already reviewed this matter have confirmed there was no reason to . suspect that the patient had TB and an appropriate screening was . performed,' the statement said. Outbreak: Families of babies born at Summerlin Hospital in Las Vegas were tested for TB following the deaths of a mother and her newborn babies . Health . officials later expanded the testing to include about 140 babies and . their family members who spent time in Summerlin Hospital's neonatal . intensive care unit over the summer. The results of that round of tests, initiated in October, have not been released. Officials . with the Southern Nevada Health District said it appears that Mrs White . contracted the disease from an unpasteurized dairy product from overseas. Lawyers plan to seek damages and changes in hospital policy. One theory is that the delayed diagnosis may have come because the disease is relatively rare in the U.S. Symptoms . can often be overlooked because the first signs of infection include . gentle aches and pains, that gradually become worse after eight weeks. 'TB . can be very subtle, particularly as many doctors have not had much . experience with TB these days,' Dr William Schaffner, professor of . preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University . School of Medicine, said. The . infection is spread through prolonged contact with a patient who is at . the contagious stage, where symptoms include coughing and spluttering. Babies who may have been exposed to the . disease are unlikely to catch it, according to chief medical officer Dr . Joe Iser, but officials want widespread testing 'through an abundance of . caution'."}

The arrested protesters included congressmen, human rights activists and faith leaders. \"We are here really to ask two very simple questions,\" Clooney said moments before his arrest. \"The first question is something immediate -- and immediately, we need humanitarian aid to be allowed into the Sudan before it becomes the worst humanitarian crisis in the world.\" The second thing, he said, \"is for the government in Khartoum to stop randomly killing its own innocent men, women and children. Stop raping them and stop starving them. That's all we ask.\" Protesters had begun gathering in the street before the protest began and converged on the Embassy once Clooney and the others arrived, holding signs reading \"Stop Bombing Civilians Now!\" and \"End the silence stop the violence.\" Those arrested included United to End Genocide President Tom Andrews; Democratic Reps. Jim McGovern, Al Green, Jim Moran and John Olver; Martin Luther King III; and NAACP President Ben Jealous. CNN iReporter films Clooney arrest . Jealous directed a message to the Sudanese president: \"This is what beginning of the end looks like.\" \"We are protesting to make sure the Sudanese government knows that the world is watching,\" McGovern said. \"The United States Congress is watching. And we will be back again and again until they stop using food as a weapon; stop slaughtering innocent men, women and children; and stop spitting in the face of the world community.\" After speeches by several of the protest leaders, a police officer told the group she was giving them a third warning, after which they would be arrested. A few moments later, the arrests began. The group stood calmly as they waited for the police to apply plastic handcuffs as the crowd of protesters chanted \"al-Bashir to the ICC,\" referring to the International Criminal Court, where Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir has been indicted. Clooney was charged with disorderly crossing of a police line, a misdemeanor, Secret Service spokesman Max Millien said. The Secret Service is responsible for security at foreign diplomatic missions in Washington. He paid a $100 fine, choosing to forfeit that money to avoid a court appearance, said Gwendolyn Crump, a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police Department. Clooney met with President Obama on Thursday to discuss his concerns about Sudan. He testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee this week about violence in the Nuba Mountains in South Kordofan, a state in Sudan near its border with newly independent South Sudan. Clooney and other activists blame the Sudanese government for attacks there that have injured and killed civilians. Clooney told the Senate committee that the attacks are being orchestrated by Sudan's government, led by al-Bashir, government official Ahmad Harun and Defense Minister Abdelrahim Mohamed Hussein -- the same three men, he said, who orchestrated long-documented attacks in Darfur. \"What you see is a constant drip of fear,\" testified Clooney, who just returned from a trip to Sudan. \"We found children filled with shrapnel, including a 9-year-old boy who had both of his hands blown off.\" This month the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Hussein, listing 41 counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes allegedly committed in the Darfur region of Sudan. Al-Bashir and Harun are also facing war crimes charges involving Darfur. Clooney is co-founder of the Satellite Sentinel Project, which uses satellite imagery to watch for aerial attacks and troop movements in Sudan and South Sudan, which became a separate country last year.

The work - expected to last one week - comes after parents and campaigners threatened to take legal action in a bid to keep the school open. Bulldozers have started tearing down Abronhill High in Cumbernauld, Lanarkshire, where they filmed the 1981 comedy Gregory's Girl . The work - expected to last a week - comes after parents and campaigners threatened to take court action in a bid to keep the school open . A group, who claimed the authority had not fulfilled its obligation under school closure legislation, raised around £5,500 to start a case against North Lanarkshire Council. But, after taking legal advice about their chances of successfully challenging the decision, the Save Abronhill High group announced in December that its campaign was at an end. Six months earlier, Scottish Ministers had rubber-stamped the local authority's decision to close the school, amid plans for a merger with another school in the area. Many of the scenes for Gregory's Girl were filmed at Abronhill High, a school which opened in 1978. The comedy starred John Gordon Sinclair as Gregory, Dee Hepburn as Dorothy and Clare Grogan as Susan. Kat Drummond, 48, a psychiatric nurse whose brother Paul, 51, was an extra in the film said: 'I'm very sad to see it go, I've been in tears about it.

'It's just not right, a bit of history is going and it was the heart of this community and will have a knock on effect, especially on the shops who relied on the kids spending money there. 'I was in the campaign to keep the school and was very vocal. We did everything we could and fought a long hard fight but unfortunately it wasn't meant to be.' She added: 'The campaign pulled the whole of Abronhill together and we fought a long hard campaign and didn't take it lying down. 'My brother was an extra in the film, he was in the cooling scene up the back washing dishes. Gregory's Girl is a 1981 Scottish coming-of-age romantic comedy film written and directed by Bill Forsyth . Many of the scenes  were filmed at the school, including in the corridors and classrooms . 'I watched it being filmed and it was a great laugh, I'm just so sad to see it go.' Last year, North Lanarkshire's learning and leisure services committee approved the merger of Abronhill and Cumbernauld High Schools. The council said the decision addressed the decreasing school roll and would create £1.3 million for the schools. Under the plan, there is due to be a new purpose-built school to replace both campuses. However, parents immediately appealed the decision to the Scottish Government, which called it in for review. The comedy starred John Gordon Sinclair as Gregory and Dee Hepburn as Dorothy (pictured) The campaign group was given a glimmer of hope when the government informed the authority that it had concerns over the educational benefit of the proposed closure, suggesting the merger move may 'lack clarity'. But, ministers approved the council's decision in June, with a number of conditions covering aspects such as funding, the timetable for change and pupil safety issues. Demolition crews have already removed the front of the building, allowing passers-by to see the inside of the classrooms. Meanwhile, a large digger is clearing up piles of rubble which were on the ground."}
{"prompt": "Muammar Gaddafi has escaped in a state-of-the-art armoured vehicle provided by Nicolas Sarkozy, it emerged today. In the latest extraordinary twist to the Libyan rebellion, it emerged that the French President gave the ‘green light’ to the Arab dictator receiving the £3.5 million converted Mercedes 4x4 in 2008. Not only is it filled with communications systems capable of keeping Gaddafi in touch with his forces, but it can foil the kind of tracking systems used by the military as they try to hunt him down. Stealthy and bulletproof: A road-going Mercedes ML, the type which has been modified with armour plating and jamming technology, and allegedly given to Muammar Gaddafi by France . It was Mr Sarkozy who ordered French jets to start bombing Gaddafi’s . forces back in March, and last week he and Prime Minister David Cameron . enjoyed a triumphant trip to the newly liberated Tripoli. But investigative news site Mediapart has found documents proving that French technology firm Amesys was allowed to provide Gaddafi with the command vehicle. The revelation comes on the day that . pro-Gaddafi fighters fired anti-aircraft guns at revolutionary forces . holding the northern gate of Bani Walid for a second day, as frustration with weeks of halting advances grows among the former rebel ranks. Launching an attack: Libyan rebel fighters fire rockets as they press forward near Ouagadougou Conference Center in the outskirts of Sirte. A second front has reportedly opened up in the city's east . Weapons salvage: Anti-Gaddafi forces sift through the abandoned weapons in Sirte, taking what they can use and destroying everything left behind. Fighting remains fierce in Gaddafi's remaining strongholds . Ragtag front line: Revolutionary forces have pulled back from Bani Walid, leaving a thin front of mainly young fighters with little experience or support . Forces - no longer rebels but the military of the National Transitional Council, Libya's interim government . - have been massed outside Bani Walid since shortly after Libya's new . rulers gained control of Tripoli and other parts of the country in . August. Block-by-block fighting continues in Gaddafi's home town of Sirte, with revolutionary forces claiming to have opened a second front in the east of the city. Of Sarkozy's armoured 4x4, Mediapart says: ‘In 2007 the sale was approved by the then Interior Minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, and his chief of staff Claude Gueant. Gadhafi spokesman Moussa Ibrahim has . told the Syrian Al-Rai TV station, the Gaddafi media mouthpiece, that 17 . mercenaries from Britain, France and Qatar had been captured near Bani . Walid. Britain's Foreign Office said it was aware of Mr Ibrahim's claims, but had no evidence that they were correct. Mr . Ibrahim said: 'A group was captured in Bani Walid consisting of 17 . mercenaries. They are technical experts and they include consultative . officers. Most of them are French, one of them is from an Asian country that has not been identified, two English people and one Qatari.' The . French foreign ministry said it had no information about the report. Qatari officials were not immediately available for comment. ‘The vehicle was eventually delivered in 2008 - this time with the green light from the President.’ The site goes on to give details of . the armoured 4X4 Mercedes ML - equipped with a protection cage made by . Faraday, which prevents all electronic fields from affecting the . vehicle. It also comes . with an electronic device capable of knocking out all radio frequencies . within some 300ft of the vehicle. This would make the kind of targeted bombing, which has seen hundreds of . Libyan Army vehicles destroyed over the past six months, almost . impossible. A military . source in Paris said: ‘Gaddafi has almost certainly used the vehicle to . get away. It is a product of superb French engineering, and an obvious . means of escape. ‘Gaddafi would be able to stay out . sight of military targeters, and be extremely well protected if he met . enemy forces on the ground.’ In . a further disastrous revelation for Mr Sarkozy, it emerged that the 4X4 . was part of a £25million-plus deal that also saw the French  provide . Libya with the means to conduct email surveillance over their own . people. The deal was . put together by the French-Lebanese arms dealer Ziad Takieddine,  which . is at the centre of a party-funding scandal involving Mr Sarkozy. The scandal, known in France as ‘Karachigate’, is linked to the selling of submarines to Pakistan. The . unidentified military source added: ‘All of this is disastrous for Mr . Sarkozy. On one hand he is presenting himself as the saviour of Libya, . while in reality he did more to keep Gaddafi in arms than almost anybody . else.’ PR disaster: Revelations that Nicolas Sarkozy essentially gave Muammar Gaddafi the means of his escape from capture will be a major embarrassment for the French President. Both men are seen here in a 2007 photo . Sherpa, a . French Internet watchdog group, last week filed a complaint against . Amesys for selling equipment to Gaddafi designed ‘to track rebel . forces’. An Elysee Palace spokesman said: ‘We have no comment to make on any of this.’ Today . trained fighters pulled away from Bani Walid to regroup and reinforce . for a new assault, after they were heavily beaten in the city Friday. Gaddafi forces opened up on the bands of ragtag, undisciplined fighters left on on the front line. These . include fighters as young as 18 who spend hours smoking hash, shooting . at plastic bottles, arguing with one another and sometimes just firing . wildly into the streets out of apparent boredom. Slow but steady progress: Anti-Gaddafi fighters advance to bomb an area where they exchange fire with Gaddafi loyalists near Herawa, 32 miles east of Sirte . Victory is in the air: As Libyan fighters chant slogans, after taking control of Gaddafi strongholds in the desert south of Tripoli, there remains the feeling that revolutionary forces will slowly but surely triumph . Fighting is raging at Sirte, Gaddafi's hometown on the Mediterranean coast. The regime stronghold of Sabha lies hundreds of miles away in the southern deserts, and there are others deep in the central deserts like the cities of Houn and Zallah. Revolutionaries involved in the battle at Sirte are more organised but have have made slow progress. Today revolutionary forces shelled the city with Grad rockets and the sound of gunfights echoed through the streets. White smoke wafted over the city, and civilians continued to flee. Gaddafi forces answered back with occasional Katyusha rockets. Regular truckloads of fuel and food arrive from Misrata to keep the fighters supplied outside Sirte. In the past three days, they have battled block-by-block into the western side of Sirte, along the beach and along a eucalyptus tree-lined main avenue parallel to the coast."}

{"prompt": "Havana, Cuba (CNN)It's a heart-pounding climb up a dark, piss-drenched stairwell. The greasy iron elevator that services the flaking 1920s apartment building seems to function only intermittently. A small group of German tourists is trapped inside. The bargain-priced apartment they've been renting maybe doesn't seem like such a good deal now. There's no word of when a maintenance engineer will show up or even if such a person exists. This is clearly no intellectual's ivory tower. And that's just the way Cuban author Pedro Juan Gutierrez likes it. \"Up here, I'm like a ghost. I've been a privileged witness to what has gone on in the neighborhood,\" he told me on a recent visit to his home. Gutierrez has been living on the top floor for more than 30 years now. He's transformed a small roof terrace into his own observation platform -- to peer down on what he calls Central Havana's \"dirty\" reality. These days, Gutierrez says he's turned to Buddhism to beat his addictions to cheap rum and wild sex. Up in his ninth-floor sanctuary, he's just about out of harm's way. But one teeter and he may just fall -- he says maybe he'll join me for a \"small drink\" down at ground level in the next few days. Gutierrez has rarely been so clean living. He says he's spent most of the last three decades prowling the streets and alleys below. \"Things are continually happening down there. Pornographic, erotic, sociological and anthropological happenings,\" he explained, wide-eyed. Gutierrez's almost 20 works of prose and poetry are foul-mouthed, cynical and scathing. The kinder literary critics have dubbed him the pioneer of \"dirty realism.\" His worst critics have condemned him as a crude pornographer -- for example, before you even finish the first page of his acclaimed \"Dirty Trilogy of Havana,\" there are graphic sexual scenes. \"Some people accuse me of exaggerating, but I say no! The reality is excessive. I have to tone things down to make it believable. It's a very brutal, violent reality, and in order to make it credible, you have to tone it down a bit,\" he says. \"But I am interested in ugliness, the ethics and the aesthetics of the 'dirty ones,' the poorest people who live right on the edge,\" he adds. His bleakest works are centered on the 1990s, during Cuba's so-called Special Period. That was just after the Soviet Union collapsed, leaving its Caribbean ally Cuba to economic wrack and ruin, devoid of subsidies or a market for its goods. But Gutierrez says not a lot has improved since then, at least in Central and Old Havana. \"Everything has stayed the same here. The same poverty, the same misery the same people who are just survivors,\" he said. \"I write about people surviving on the limits.\" Jabbing his finger into the afternoon sun, Gutierrez points out Neptuno, Colon, Trocadero and San Lazaro, the four streets that he says once formed Cuba's largest red light district, before the 1959 Revolution. He suggests that prostitution, migration from the countryside to the capital and the disintegration of extended families are the root causes of the chaos he says still reigns in this area. \"There were hundreds or thousands of hookers down there. The people left there today are the daughters and the granddaughters of the hookers. That's important to note in social terms. This was never a normal neighborhood,\" he explained with a grin. Gutierrez worked for 26 years as a journalist for state-run newspapers and magazines. But when he began publishing his crude and critical brand of fiction, he was fired. He's pushed the boundaries of free speech in Cuba but has never been jailed for speaking his mind. He seems to have little intention of keeping quiet. \"I'm soon going to be 65. I have to take advantage of those years to say what I have to say. People don't dare; they just die with their mouths shut. When you have ideas, you have to express them,\" Gutierrez said. His literary depiction of his neighbors here in Central Havana may seem harsh. But walking the streets, you can quickly see he may have a valid point. A few doors from his apartment building, there's the entrance to the local Revolutionary Defense Committee, a neighborhood group set up to promote the values of the Revolution. On the door, a black-and-white photo of a young Fidel Castro. Diagonally opposite is a small store with welded bars at the window. The only thing inside, a huge vat of white rum. A half measure sells for 40 cents and a full 750 ml goes for 80 cents. It was only mid-morning, but a man rooted through the trash outside, pulled out a small plastic bottle and with trembling hands asked for a fill-up. That surely cannot be what Castro -- enshrined in the poster across the street -- had in mind: A land where tourists drink mint-filled mojitos while a few blocks away, an alcoholic worker knocks back a huge slug of  \"train sparks,\" the name Cubans colloquially give to cheap, industrial-strength rum. \"This neighborhood always was on the margins of all the talk of revolutionary ideals. Maybe in the '70s and '80s, when there was some kind of revolutionary pride, it was a little different. But generally, people stayed on the sidelines,\" Gutierrez told me. While his works are bitingly critical of the decades-long social breakdown in his neighborhood, his overall outlook on life and the Cuban system is more nuanced. When Castro and his rebels seized power in 1959, Gutierrez was 7 years old, selling ice cream on Havana's streets. He recalls the brutality of the outgoing dictatorship of General Fulgencio Batista and the celebrations and hopes for newfound freedom ushered in by the rebel forces. \"There was a lot of joy in the first few days. It was like freedom had arrived,\" he said. Despite the experiences of the decades since then, Gutierrez says he still considers himself a \"romantic\" leftist. He rejects suggestions that he has anything in common with Cuba's right-wing dissident movement. \"I think (the regime) is trying to save the good things of socialism and the Revolution like education, health and national pride. We still have to advance a great deal in human rights and personal freedoms,\" he added. For some of Gutierrez's neighbors, change cannot come fast enough. It's past midnight in a dive bar on Galliano Street. A washed-up boxer, Agustin, croons along to a salsa tune on the TV, then asks for a double-strength rum and coke. He says he was a bantamweight Olympic and Pan-American Games champion. When it comes to boxers, Cuba has proved itself to be in a sporting class of its own. But now 50, Agustin has little left to show for his glory years except for a nose like a lump of rubber -- broken so many times, he has no cartilage left. In a hotel bar, a few doors down, on Havana's Malecon waterfront, a 33-year-old woman clad in leopard-print hot pants sips on a Cristal beer and strikes up a conversation. She says police once gave her a ticket for \"harassing tourists,\" official speak for prostitution. She says her day job is a physical education teacher for primary school children. She earns just $10 a month with her state salary and spends that in the bat of one of her false eyelashes. But she says the job provides her with a vital cover story. Having legitimate employment, she says, keeps her out of trouble with the law when she turns tricks at night. She charges her foreign clients $100 a night, if they don't bargain her down, she says. Like many others, she has high hopes that she will be able to cash in on the potential influx of American tourists, after President Barack Obama's announcement of more stable U.S.-Cuba relations. But back up the street, Gutierrez is not convinced there will be a quick fix to those relations. The problem, he says, are elderly Cubans on both sides of the Florida Straits. \"For more than half a century, there's been a lot of hatred between Cubans in the U.S. and those on the island. There's been a lot of thirst for revenge. We have to wait for the years to pass and the old men to die,\" he says. \"Only then can we resolve things in a civilized way.\""}

Marshawn Lynch has fired back at his critics at the Super Bowl Thursday (above), explaining why he does not speak to the press . This as Lynch and his Seattle Seahawks are set to take on the New England Patriots Sunday . When Lynch arrived at the podium, a man with a reporter's credential who said he was a teacher asked him to give his students a 'shoutout.' But the running back wouldn't bite and began his unscripted statement. 'Y'all shove cameras and microphones down my throat' Lynch continued. 'But when I'm at home in my environment, I don't see y'all, but y'all mad at me. And if you ain't mad at me, then what y'all here for? I ain't got nothing for y'all, though. I told y'all that.'

And y'all want to ask me these questions, which is understandable. I could get down with that. But I told y'all. I'm not about to say nothing. ... All of my requirements are fulfilled.' Lynch praised his teammates, his hometown of Oakland, California, and his Family First Foundation. When asked who the best player on the Seahawks was, he said: \"All of them.\" As he has all week, Lynch stayed five minutes before leaving. At Media Day on Tuesday, Lynch repeated: 'I'm just here so I don't get fined' while talking to reporters. On Wednesday, he replied to all questions with: 'You know why I'm here.'

In November, the NFL fined him $50,000 for violations of the league's media policy in addition to collecting the $50,000 fine that was imposed against Lynch for violations last season. The fine from 2013 was held in anticipation of future cooperation from Lynch. The Professional Football Writers of America complained to the league about Tuesday's session and Lynch had been apprised of a potential fine. A league spokesman declined comment. Lynch again wore a Beast Mode baseball cap and told everyone where they could buy one.

Thousands of teachers and other public sector workers are employed by off-shore firms in a scheme described as ‘the next big UK tax scandal’. Taxpayers are losing out on millions of pounds in national insurance contributions because of the controversial arrangements, a BBC investigation has claimed. Schools and councils which hired the teachers could now be forced to foot the bill for the unpaid tax. Thousands of teachers and other public sector workers are employed by off-shore firms in a scheme described as ¿the next big UK tax scandal¿ (file picture) One firm based in Sark, one of the Channel Islands, employs more than 24,000 temporary agency workers in the UK, mostly supply teachers, according to the investigation by BBC 5 Live. The staff are recruited by UK-based recruitment agencies, which insist they use the services of the Sark-based firm, International Subcontracting Solutions, to handle the payment of their salaries and expenses. It means the teachers are technically employees of ISS, which claims to work with more than 900 UK recruitment agencies. The firm ensures the teachers pay tax and employee national insurance contributions but since it is based offshore, does not pay the employer’s contribution to national insurance. The BBC said the UK agencies that place the teachers are not paying employers’ national insurance either, leaving a huge tax liability. HM Revenue and Customs warned that schools and councils, or the recruitment agencies, could be forced to cover the shortfall. Richard Murphy, director of Tax Research UK, told the BBC that the growth of ‘umbrella companies’ such as ISS was ‘the next big UK tax scandal’. He said: ‘The UK can’t afford this tax loss and it can’t afford so many households being put at tax risk. This is a scandal waiting to break.’ Crawford Temple, director of tax consultancy Professional Passport, said he wrote to the Treasury in July 2011 to warn about the use of off-shore companies to employ public sector agency workers. But he told 5 Live Investigates, which airs at 9pm tonight, that ministers failed to respond. Mr Temple said schools or councils could end up paying out twice as much as they need to. One Channel Islands firm employs more than 24,000 temporary agency staff, mostly supply teachers, according to a BBC investigation (file picture) This is because schools pay a rate to their recruitment suppliers that covers all relevant tax and NI contributions. The rate is the same where the supply teacher is employed via an offshore provider.If HMRC enforces collection of employer’s national insurance and goes to schools for it, they would effectively pay double, he said. On its website, ISS says it is ‘an employment business, often referred to as an umbrella company’. It adds: ‘ISS is able to provide contractors with a more tax effective salary package than an agency. ISS operates a… tax efficient payroll structure, which allows you to maximise your pay, while maintaining a full UK tax record.’ ISS could not be reached for comment but told the BBC the company is ‘meticulous in complying with HMRC codes on taxes and expenses’. It also said HMRC had no grounds to challenge either its employees or business partners. In a statement, HMRC said: ‘These kinds of arrangements are not compliant with tax and national insurance legislation and the end client or the employment businesses may be liable for any underpaid tax and national insurance.’"}
{"prompt": "The hunt to become the home of Barack Obama's lasting White House legacy has become a game of presidential library survivor.  For now, the President's native Hawaii can only hope, to borrow a phrase, that it is not voted off the island. \"I would just note that the President chooses to spend his winters in Honolulu, not Chicago,\" said Hawaii's recently elected Gov. David Ige, who touted the islands' appeal as the First Family's annual refuge during the holiday season. Still, Ige acknowledged his state is an underdog in its competition with the three other remaining proposed bids to win the multimillion dollar project: two in Chicago and one in New York. \"Hawaii has been the underdog before. We trust the President and the foundation will make the best decision,\" Ige added during an interview at his office in the state capitol. In between rounds of golf, the president conceivably has had time to decide where to place his library. But White House officials declined to comment on whether any meetings on the topic have occurred over his winter vacation in Hawaii. In many respects, Hawaii's proposed Honolulu site is a strong contender.  The eight-acre parcel of land is on the city's spectacular waterfront, looking out on Waikiki Beach and Oahu's iconic Diamond Head peak.  Another perk, Ige noted, is that this slice of paradise is already owned by the state. There are, however, some potential drawbacks to Honolulu.  Set apart from the U.S. mainland, Hawaii is hardly a convenient place to preserve presidential documents. Presidential libraries are intended for researchers and historians, not foreign tourists and families on vacation, a source close to Hawaii's bid conceded. Another potential obstacle is that a sizable portion of the site has been transformed into a tent village by dozens of Honolulu's homeless, including women and children who would be forced to move to another part of the city. A homeless woman who called herself \"Bernie\" said the tent village is buzzing with rumors the city will push out the area's inhabitants to make way for development. \"Now we know why we got to leave. I have no problem that they want to make a library. But where is the rest of everyone going?\" she asked. Bernie suggested Obama pay the area a visit. \"He should come back and take a look. It's like they're trying to hide us back here, trying to shove us back here,\" she added. There is a sense of resignation in the tent village that the waterfront area may well be selected as the home of the Barack Obama Presidential Library. \"I guess he can do whatever he wants to do. He's the President. I better keep quiet. I might offend people,\" said another woman, who asked to be identified only as Grace, as she served hot meals to homeless people out of the back of her car. Honolulu city officials explain the homeless tent village on the city's proposed library site will have to be moved either way, as developers have plans for new construction, with or without a presidential museum. Despite those issues, Honolulu's prospects did receive a possible boost this week from the city once considered the front-runner to host the presidential library, Obama's adopted hometown of Chicago. The Obama Foundation, which has been tasked to lead the library search, has raised \"major\" concerns about the two proposals coming from Chicago, according to sources familiar with the selection process. Foundation officials are alarmed that the sites included in a pitch from the University of Chicago are controlled by city Park District officials. The foundation would rather have the university in charge of the land in order to ease construction. Concerns with a separate proposal from the University of Illinois-Chicago stem from upcoming leadership changes there. The city of Chicago is urgently working to remedy the problems with the University of Chicago proposal by clarifying how the land can be used, said an aide to Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Obama's former White House chief of staff. But city officials concede there is little they can do about the University of Illinois' issues. In an indication of how fierce the library competition has become, Hawaii's governor grinned upon hearing about Chicago's problems, describing them as \"terrific\" for his own state's prospects. The other remaining contender for the library, Columbia University in New York, may be benefiting from the issues plaguing the Honolulu and Chicago bids.  One sticking point in selecting Columbia's upper-Manhattan neighborhood: It already boasts one ex-president, Bill Clinton, who keeps an office there. For now, the Obama Foundation is taking a restrained approach in commenting on the looming decision that the President and first lady are expected to make in early 2015. \"The foundation is evaluating all four respondents across a variety of criteria. Each institution is unique and has different strengths and weaknesses relative to the others,\" the foundation said. With the President and first family still in Oahu, Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell is hoping to give the Obamas his best pitch before they return to Washington. He plans to see the Obamas off on the tarmac at Hickam Field when they fly out this weekend, though will only raise the library if the feeling is right. \"Any time I get with the President, I will try my best to make a plug for our site,\" he said. \"But I want to send him off with aloha.\" Acknowledging Hawaii's long odds to win the selection process, Ige and Caldwell are both suggesting an alternative proposal of splitting Obama's post-presidential home, with the official library in either Chicago or New York and a separate presidential center in Honolulu. Caldwell said he has joked with Emanuel, Chicago's outspoken mayor, about the library competition. \"I've joked around a little bit with Rahm Emanuel, and there's a chance we share parts of it,\" Caldwell said.  \"But I do believe for people to truly understand the President they have to understand this place,\" he added. While Hawaii is certainly remote, Ige noted the islands already act as a cultural bridge between the United States and Asia. Add to that the state's large Asian-American population, and a Hawaii presidential library would neatly reflect Obama's goal of pivoting U.S. foreign policy to Asia, Ige argued. \"We believe the presidential center would allow the President to really showcase what he believes as we move forward,\" Ige said. \"The multicultural fabric of Hawaii is such a profound statement of his desires,\" he added.​ ."}
{"prompt": "Of all the rumours that dogged Princess Diana’s life, it was surely the one that hurt her the most: that James Hewitt – not Prince Charles – was the father of her second child. Now that painful insinuation has been reignited after Hewitt gave his backing to a controversial new West End play suggesting that he could indeed be Prince Harry’s father. The Mail on Sunday can reveal the former cavalry officer has allowed himself to be portrayed in the production Truth, Lies, Diana, which contains explosive revelations about his relationship with the Princess. Fond looks: James Hewitt and Diana (left) watch Prince Harry (far right) during a visit to an Army base in 1989 . The author of the play, which makes its debut at London’s Charing Cross Theatre on January 9, says it is based on extensive interviews with figures who knew Diana ‘in their own words’, including Hewitt and Paul Burrell, her former butler. In one sensational scene Hewitt tells a journalist: ‘Diana and I started our relationship more than a year before Harry was born. Now that doesn’t prove that I am his father. It’s just the... inconvenient truth.’ Hewitt, 56, last night confirmed that he knows author Jon Conway and spoke to him about his relationship with Diana, and said he had no doubt the play would be ‘accurate’. He said he had not seen the play or read specific scenes even though Conway claimed he had sent him 15 pages of the script for his approval. Conway said: ‘I have been talking to James over a period of two years. I met him and he told me some quite remarkable things that have never been said in the public domain, particularly about when his relationship with Diana started. ‘There is a startling revelation that James Hewitt makes and he has allowed me to make it in the play. This is the fact that his relationship with Diana started 18 months before Prince Harry was born.’ He added: ‘We are not saying he is Prince Harry’s father although the audience may take their own view on that. Hewitt gave his backing to the West End play - which suggests he could indeed be Harry’s father . ‘I don’t know if James Hewitt is Prince Harry’s father and James Hewitt has always denied it either because it isn’t true or out of some sense of loyalty.’ The play, about a journalist trying to find out the truth about Diana’s death in 1997, does not feature a depiction of the Princess herself, but it does include claims about her life, including the unfounded suggestion she was pregnant with Dodi Fayed’s baby when she died. But it is the references to Prince Harry’s paternity which are likely to be the most shocking. In the play, the character of Hewitt insists that he has always denied being Prince Harry’s father, but the play still includes several references to the issue. When the journalist, who is played by Conway, asks Hewitt if he knows who Prince Harry’s father is, he pauses before answering: ‘Of course I do.’ The subject is touched upon again when Hewitt discusses his decision to pursue a military career like his father. He is asked if he would like his own son to follow family tradition before two pictures of him and Harry in near identical military uniform appear on screen. Royal commentators last night branded the play as ‘a nonsense’. But Conway, previously a producer who wrote the successful 2010 musical All The Fun Of The Fair which starred David Essex, said all the revelations in the play were either taken from official documents or were based on interviews with key figures from Diana’s life. Conway said he had shown Hewitt the scenes in advance and that the former officer had approved them. Rumours about Prince Harry’s paternity first began to circulate in 1994 when revelations about his mother’s affair with Hewitt became public. For more than a decade Hewitt denied the claims and insisted that his affair with Diana did not start until 1986 when the Prince was already two years old. Princess Diana pictured with Harry. The rumour that Hewitt is Prince Harry's father - and not Prince Charles - dogged Diana's life . But in 2005 the disgraced publicist Max Clifford claimed in a biography that Hewitt had confided to him that the relationship predated Prince Harry’s birth. Royal commentators last night rubbished the new claims and insisted there was no way Hewitt was the Prince’s father. Penny Junor, who has just published an acclaimed biography of Prince Harry, said: ‘I have spoken to people around at the time and they all say that James Hewitt wasn’t in the picture before 1986. Diana didn’t hide Hewitt when the relationship began. She kept him in plain sight.’ Respected Royal author Margaret Holder said the claims in the play were a ‘nonsense’ and that Hewitt was simply trying to raise his profile. She said: ‘I think this will put him back in the spotlight and it tells producers of reality TV programmes, “Hello, I’m here.” It’s a nonsense but it’s all a game.’ Biographer Hugo Vickers said the play’s claims were not surprising given the people who had been interviewed by Conway. He said: ‘If you talk to certain people you will get a version of events these people are keen to peddle. They have an agenda of their own.’ The controversial play is to be staged at Charing Cross Theatre in London. It makes its debut on January 9 . Hewitt last night confirmed he knew Conway but he declined to be drawn on the play’s contents. He said: ‘I do know Jon. I am aware that he has done a play and I am sure that it is accurate. I obviously have not seen it yet.’ When pushed on the specific line in the play about the timing of his affair with Diana, he said: ‘That is not my quote.’ He also insisted that he had not seen the script for the play. He said: ‘I have not seen the script. Neither have I seen the play. It would be foolish to comment on it before doing so.’ Hewitt last night refused to say when his relationship with Diana began and declined to be drawn on the issue of Prince Harry’s parentage. He said: ‘I wish this subject would go away. It’s never going to and that’s just the way of life.’ A spokesman for Clarence House last night declined to comment."}

The NSW government has announced that it will provide medical cannabis to children suffering from extreme forms of epilepsy . Premier Mike Baird said almost $9 million will be invested in clinical trials to see how the drug could possibly provide relief to sufferers of epilepsy and from the effects of chemotherapy. The breakthrough comes just days after Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews spoke about his plans to legalise the drug. Mr Baird said the government aims to establish a Medical Cannabis Expert Panel which will include NSW Chief Medical Officer, Dr Kerry Chant, and employees from the University of Sydney.

If the cannabis cannot be imported, the Premier has confirmed that the government are prepared to spearhead a homegrown medical cannabis industry . 'Once we have the clinical evidence that medical cannabis can reduce suffering then the government will consider a range of supply measures, including importation. But if that does not prove successful then the government will assume responsibility for supply itself,' Mr Baird said. However, Dr John Lawson from Sydney Children's Hospital in Randwick, told the paper that only a small number of children will benefit from this research, as some might not respond well to the drug.

{"prompt": "Ferguson, Missouri (CNN)The embattled police here are testing something no other department in America has tried, in an effort to prevent another potentially explosive incident in which an officer kills an unarmed civilian. Ferguson police are evaluating a new attachment to their guns that could give a suspect a chance to live in an otherwise lethal encounter with police. This latest piece of weapons technology is called \"The Alternative,\" and it's an orange-colored plastic device mounted on a gun barrel that turns the first fired bullet into a pingpong ball-sized projectile, designed not to kill. Several officers have been trained on how to use it, but city officials have yet to decide on making the gear a requirement. \"It's something we're testing for ourselves and seeing if this is even something feasible or reasonable to use for law enforcement officers,\" Mayor James Knowles told CNN. The testing began just a week shy of the six-month anniversary of the killing of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown by then-Officer Darren Wilson, who is white and has since quit the force. The August police shooting sparked an intense, sometimes violent reaction from Ferguson residents, and demonstrations spread across the country. Protesters condemned police tactics as brutal and excessive against minorities, citing other police killings of black men, often unarmed. The new gun technology is being evaluated as a remedy to the simmering tension between police and community members. Local officials didn't want to speculate whether the device could have altered the outcome of the Brown-Wilson encounter. Wilson, who was cleared of any criminal wrongdoing, told a grand jury that as he sat in his squad car, Brown, who was outside the vehicle, punched him in the face. Wilson fired multiple shots at Brown, killing him. When the gun is fired, the bullet embeds in a golf ball-sized metal bulb, attached at the muzzle. The bullet fuses inside the metal sphere, and the unit morphs into a speeding ball. Impact would be painful, but the projectile could be far less lethal than a naked bullet, the manufacturer said. Getting hit could break bones and even kill. \"It's gonna feel like you had a professional baseball player hit you in the chest with a hammer, so it is going to hurt,\" said Christian Ellis, the CEO of Alternative Ballistics. \"There is a possibility that this could kill you, but it is very slight when you compare that to a bullet.\" His firm spent nine years developing the invention. \"It was actually created by a retired sheriff officer. He did not like the fact that people were being shot when the officers do have time (to consider options) but they had no other option in lethal force,\" Ellis said. \"So this product gives the officer another option in that scenario when it's not reactive, and they do have the time to put it on,\" he said, referring to mounting the device at the end of a gun barrel. The device, also called a docking unit, costs $45 and has a one-time use. It ejects itself from the muzzle after the police gun is fired. An officer can return to shooting again in a split second, and the bullets will be direct and unhampered. Ellis describes the technology as one more tool for an officer's belt. It provides an option that could spare the life of a threatening suspect. \"It's like an airbag for a bullet. So the risk is worth the reward to have an airbag in the car, and the risk is worth the reward if the officer can safely use our technology,\" he said. The device isn't without controversy. It could put an officer's life in danger, some retired law officers say. \"Our problem is not with the device, our problem is with the concept. This device ignores the human factor,\" said Charles \"Sid\" Heal, a retired member of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and a consultant on alternatives to lethal force. He pointed out that The Alternative would be used in situations that could escalate with little warning, forcing officers to make yet another decision in a critical moment their lives may be on the line. \"When you're under a lot of stress, you lose your fine motor skills and, as a result of that, pulling a trigger and thinking are far more complex than most people realize,\" Heal said. Ellis understands the reluctance on the part of some departments to test the new technology, but he noted how other former law enforcement personnel have been helping develop the device. Ellis said the device is not for use when an officer must make a split-second decision, such as when a suspect pulls a gun. Rather, it's to be used when an officer has three or more seconds to decide. During that time, an officer can place the attachment on the gun while pointing it at a suspect. So far, The Alternative has never been tested on the human body, and it has not been used in real-life situations. Ferguson police have trained with the device on their shooting range, but it hasn't been taken or used on the streets. Mayor Knowles emphasized how his city continues to evaluate the technology. \"It hasn't been used by anyone else, which is why we are doing all of our due diligence, making sure it's properly tested, that it does not put anyone, especially our law enforcement, in any increased danger, and we'll just make a decision based on that,\" he said.

Twitter has announced it is rolling out a ‘while you were away’ summary feature (illustrated) across its apps and website. The tool shows users a selection of tweets that it considers to be important, and that the user may have missed since they last logged in . In a blog post detailing the changes, Product Manager, Paul Rosania wrote: 'Today we’re introducing something new to your home timeline: a recap of some of the top Tweets you might have missed from accounts you follow.' 'Our goal is to help you keep up - or catch up - with your world, no matter how much time you spend on Twitter. 'With a few improvements to the home timeline we think we can do a better job of delivering on that promise without compromising the real time nature of Twitter' The feature was first spotted by a number of users over Christmas. It works in a similar way to Facebook’s news feed feature, which ranks status updates in terms of importance, instead of in chronological order. The best tweets are displayed at the top of a user’s timeline when they open the site, and are similar to the 'Top stories' prioritised on Facebook. The feature was first spotted by some users (an example is shown) in December, but the feature has now been officially unveiled . The tool was officially announced by Twitter today, despite some users seeing the new feature pop up in their news feeds since December. It shows users a selection of tweets that it considers to be important, and that the user may have missed since they last logged in. The best tweets are displayed at the top of a user’s timeline when they open the site, and are similar to the 'Top stories' prioritised on Facebook. Twitter didn't explicitly explain how it prioritises tweets, but said that it will pull out the best ones 'determined by engagement and other factors' to fill in the gaps. Twitter said the new feature is designed to help users keep up and catch up with news, no matter how regularly they check Twitter. The update will roll out on iOS devices from today and will be coming 'soon' to Android devices and twitter.com. The Facebook tool has previously angered some users who believe they should be able to choose how stories appear - and the Twitter update is likely to cause similar frustrations. The site did not explicitly reveal how it prioritises tweets, or what it considers 'important' but said that it will pull out the best tweets, 'determined by engagement and other factors' to fill in the gaps in news while users are away. Mr Rosania explained: 'If you check in on Twitter now and then for a quick snapshot of what’s happening, you’ll see this recap more often; if you spend a lot of time on Twitter already, you’ll see it less.' Users who access Twitter on iPhones and iPads will begin to see the 'while you were away' feature from today, while it will appear on the company's Android app and twitter.com 'soon'. Twitter first announced its plans to roll out features to boost engagement in November, stating at the time: ‘Every time you open the Twitter app, you’ll see something great.’ It added: ‘We can use information like who you follow and what you engage with to surface highlights of what you missed and show those to you as soon as you log back in or come back to the app.’ The best tweets are displayed at the top of a user’s timeline when they open the app (pictured) or website - a new feature, which has delighted some, while annoying others who took to Twitter to complain . It works in a similar way to Facebook’s Top stories news feed feature, which ranks status updates in terms of importance, instead of in chronological order (pictured). The Facebook tool has previously angered some users who believe they should be able to choose how stories appear . In November Twitter revealed its plans for the ‘while you were away’ feature. Here is what it said in a blog post: . 'Right now, what you see of the 500 million tweets published every day is based entirely on who you follow, and that’s a great model for many people. 'But with that many tweets every day, there’s no way even the most avid Twitter user will find everything that’s relevant to their interests in any particular moment. 'That’s why we’re exploring ways to surface relevant tweets so the content that is interesting to you is easy to discover - whether you stay on Twitter all day or visit for a few minutes - while still preserving the real-time nature of the platform that makes Twitter special. 'For instance, we’re experimenting with better ways to give you what you come to Twitter for: a snapshot of what’s happening. 'We can use information like who you follow and what you engage with to surface highlights of what you missed and show those to you as soon as you log back in or come back to the app. 'We’re also working on ideas such as an instant, personalised timeline for new users who don’t want to spend time cultivating one on their own.' The 'while you were away' feature is the first one rolled out by the company, based in San Francisco, California, since it launched promoted tweets and adverts, which also buck its chronological approach. The tool is designed to attract a user's attention to important tweets that can get easily lost in the rapid flow of information, especially if they follow hundreds of people, or do not check their feed very regularly. A staggering 500 million tweets are published every day. People reacted on Twitter to the change, with some pouring scorn on the new feature. Before the official roll-out was announced, one user wrote: '#Twitter new feature to tell me what happened while I was away. I was away because I didn't want to know anything', while another said: ‘Why does Twitter show me tweets from last night \"while you were away\" .. Wack.’ However, one Californian user was among many who praised the change, saying: ‘Love the 'While You Were Away' feature at Twitter. Achieves its purpose without affecting real time news feed!’ The new feature may be seen as a move by Twitter to close in on Facebook’s social media lead, which has 1.3 billion users, compared to Twitter’s 284 million. Twitter is expected to roll out another new feature called ‘instant timeline’ to reinvigorate current users and attract news ones early this year. Last year, Snapchat leapfrogged Twitter to become the third most used social media app (pictured). Twitter is now releasing new features to make its offering more appealing to current and new users . In August, Snapchat leapfrogged Twitter to become the third most used social media app. Almost a third of 18 to 24-year-olds use the self-destructing messaging app, which is more than double the amount of users the company had in November. Facebook still reigns as the most popular, however, with more than 75 per cent of millennials using it, closely followed by Instagram with 43 per cent. Snapchat's popularity is growing among 25 to 34-year-olds, and in the over 35 age group - albeit more slowly than among the younger age group.

French prosecutors have launched a murder inquiry into the 2004 death of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Arafat died in a French military hospital in 2004 from what doctors said at the time was a stroke. But new evidence and pressure from his widow and a TV investigation have prompted authorities to examine the possibility he was actually poisoned. There have long been rumours in the Arab world that Arafat was poisoned, and a Swiss lab's recent finding of elevated levels of a rare and highly lethal radioactive substance on Arafat's clothing has fed those claims. However, the Institute of Radiation Physics said its findings were inconclusive and that only exhuming Arafat's remains could bring possible clarity. Palestinian officials have waffled on the matter - initially approving the exhumation and then saying the matter needed more study - only further fueling suspicions. Still, since Arafat's death, several senior Palestinian officials have alleged that Israel poisoned the Palestinian leader, a charge Israel vehemently denied. Testing Arafat's bones for . polonium-210 - the substance found on his clothes - could offer the last . chance to get to the bottom of Palestinian claims that their leader was . poisoned, though some experts say it may already be too late for . conclusive answers. Cause of death: Doctors at the Val de Grace hospital in Paris said he died from a stroke . Investigation: Arafat's widow Suha Arafat, pictured here alongside then Palestinian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nabil Shaath (left) and then French Prime Minister Jean Pierre Raffarin, has reportedly filed a legal complaint into her husband's death . Many have speculated that Arafat, whose West Bank grave is pictured here, was killed by an Israeli spy agency . Scientists caution that polonium decays quickly and that an autopsy needs to be done right away. The findings were first . broadcast by Arab satellite TV station Al-Jazeera, which approached the . lab on behalf of Arafat's widow, Suha. She provided the lab with his clothing and other belongings. When the results were released, Suha Arafat filed a complaint in French court asking for a murder investigation. The . two judicial officials - who would only speak on condition of anonymity . because of office rules - said a judge will be appointed to run the . investigation shortly. The complaint is open and does not name a responsible party, as is a common practice in French courts. Slow death: Russian security agent Alexander Litvinenko before his death in November 2006 . Rumours suggesting Arafat was poisoned by Israeli intelligence agents have swirled around the middle east for years - fuelled by a recent investigation into a urine stain found on his underwear. Tests found the urine had traces of Polonium-210, the highly radioactive substance that killed Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko (pictured) in 2006. Other theories have speculated that Arafat actually died after contracting cancer, cirrhosis, or even HIV. Those exposed to a lethal dose of Polonium, usually by ingesting it, die within 2-3 months. In most cases there are no serious symptoms for a week after being exposed, but nausea and fatigue would set in soon after. In . theory, just a microgram of Polonium - the same as a spec of dust - is . enough to kill someone, due to its slowly-excreted alpha particles which . affect the body's organs. After ingestion, Polonium affects the liver, kidneys, spleen, bone marrow, and gastrointestinal tract. Serious . illness would not be expected for a month, due to the amount of time it . takes to accumulate dangerous internal exposures. As . the severity of the exposure develops in the body, victims usually lose . hair, and the lining of the gastrointestinal system is destroyed. This later leads to severe diarrhea, intestinal bleeding, loss of fluids, and disturbance of electrolyte balance. Though . it takes 5-6 weeks to seriously affect most, the symptoms of Polonium . poisoning contrast to the case of Litvinenko who fell ill the . day after he was exposed. The Russian died 23 days after being exposed, an indication that he was poisoned with many times the required lethal dosage."}
{"prompt": "You know how the old saying goes when two people fall in love at first sight...their eyes met across a crowded room. Next they were being seduced by the open wounds all over each other's faces and lusting after the blood dripping from their snarling mouths. Okay, not quite. In fact not all, unless you're Kelly Buckley and her partner Tim Lamb who are planning a fairytale wedding after meeting as they played zombies in a horror movie. Kelly, 30, fell for Tim Lamb, 39 after they were cast together alongside 300 other extras as flesh eating monsters who terrorise a community in a British film called The Eschatrilogy. Scroll down for video . When Kelly Buckley first met her fiance Tim Lamb (left) it was love at first sight even though they were both covered head to toe in blood, mud and deep gashes (right) Initially Kelly suffered a  set back when she forgot to get Tim's phone number. But the pair met by chance again at a ghost hunt earlier this year and realised they had met previously on set. Now the couple are due to tie the knot after Tim popped the question. Kelly, a mother of two from Sheffield, South Yorkshire said: 'We were going to have a zombie themed wedding but as it is going to be in Australia our latex make up would probably melt in the searing heat. Kelly said she loved Tim's sense of humour straight away and the pair share a love of comics and superheros . Kelly and Tim only crossed over on the set of the independent movie for one day, losing contact for months . 'As we both love comics, we're going to have a superhero themed wedding instead with the female guests playing damsels in distress in summer dresses whilst Tim will wear a Batman shirt. But we'll still be having a zombie element to the wedding as that is how we met - so in the vows we'll be saying we promise to save each other from a zombie apocalypse.' Kelly met Tim in 2012 after she saw a Facebook post advertising for extras to appear in the movie which was filmed at a disused warehouse in Wakefield. She was among 300 extras who underwent an hour of make-up before the group were split into separate 'zombie hordes.' She added: 'I had been single for a few years and thought that this zombie extra work would be a great opportunity to make some new friends. 'I arrived at 9am had all my makeup done by 11am and spent the rest of the day high on adrenaline. 'It certainly wasn't the kind of place I thought I would fancy anyone, everyone looked as realistic as the zombies in Walking Dead. After meeting again by chance and adding each other on Facebook Kelly realised that he was her mystery zombie and within a few months they became a couple . 'I just remember hearing this loud bloke a few meters away from me and remember everyone laughing at his jokes about zombies and about how he looked better with the make-up on rather than off - I liked him instantly. 'We really hit it off, both of us liked computer games and comic books but because the day was so busy I didn't have chance to get his number. Filming was ongoing for another three months so I was sure I would see him again - but I was absolutely gutted when he didn't turn up the next day.' 'The problem was I had no idea what he looked like, I spent a good few months keeping my eyes and ears out for him, but I never saw him after that. I spent hours searching for Tim during the three months of filming but unfortunately he'd finished his stint that day.' Months later, by chance, the pair bumped into each other after she reluctantly went to a ghost hunting night with a friend. It was there she met a man who was also called Tim and they hit it off straight away. The pairs love of dressing up means they will dress as superheros for their wedding in Australia, though unfortunately the heat means the latex zombie make up would have melted . After adding each other on Facebook Kelly realised that he was her mystery zombie and within a few months they became a couple. Tim moved from Leeds with his son Paul, 11, to be with Kelly and her daughters Paige, 12 and Millie, 6. In June 2014 Tim proposed to Kelly at the same spot when they first met as zombies. Kelly said: 'When I met Tim again at the ghost hunting event, I didn't even realise it was him and didn't put two and two together. 'I had never seen Tim without his zombie make up on so for all I know he could have been anyone.' Kelly has since donned her zombie costumes for numerous other events such as Tattoo shows, television work and even for an Alice Cooper. She hopes to continue her zombie work and couldn't think of a better job. She said: 'Tim only did extra work that one time, I think he found it quite long as we were there from 9am all the way up till 7pm. 'For me though I absolutely love it, I look forward to dressing up - I find the whole experience fascinating. Plus it gave me the love of my life, even if I didn't know what he looked like as a human. People have been joking with un-dead happy in love.'"}

Prolific thief Stephanie Swanston, 25, was caught shoplifting and driving her grandfather's car in November last year . Serial thief Stephanie Swanston was caught shoplifting, after stealing her grandfather's car to drive to the supermarket where she gave her sisters name to the police officers who snared her. The 25-year-old was released from prison four months ago after forging the signatures of three of her grandparents - one of whom was in hospital at the time - and her sister to fraudulently apply for £10,000 in benefits. She has a string of offences, and has stolen from almost every member of her family. In the latest episode in Swanston's history of offending, security staff spotted her leaving Asda in Gosforth, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, after stealing a pair of hair clippers. When police officers arrived to arrest her, the 25-year-old was found to be driving her grandfather George Swanston's Vauxhall Corsa and gave her sister Victoria Swanston's details. Swanston, of Gateshead, initially pleaded not guilty to one count of theft and one of taking a motor vehicle without consent. But she changed her plea on the day of trial, confessing to the crimes. She had already pleaded guilty to driving without a licence, driving with no insurance and obstructing a police officer at an earlier hearing. Lynne Russell, prosecuting, told Newcastle Magistrates' Court that the offences happened at Asda, in Gosforth, on November 23 last year. She said: 'She (Swanston) was seen on CCTV taking a box of hair clippers and she left the store without offering payment. 'She was detained by staff and the police were called and officers attended. The 25-year-old was spotted leaving this Asda store in Gosforth, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, with a pair of hair clippers in her pocket. When police officers arrived and arrested her, Swanston gave her sister Victoria's details . Stephanie Swanston's criminal record reveals 35 previous convictions. In April 2010 she targeted her parents, grandfathers and uncle in a string of scams, stealing nearly £3,000 for fund overseas holidays. She also made £7,500 worth of failed loan applications in relatives' names and pawned two of her mother's watches. She was sentenced to six months in prison. Months after being released she fleeced her grandparents out of more than £2,000 after stealing their bank cards. Within three weeks, Swanston targeted four Sainsburys stores, stealing electrical goods before trying to return them in exchange for a refund. In April last year the 25-year-old was jailed for six months after fraudulently claiming carer's allowance, crisis loans and jobseeker's allowance, totalling more than £10,000. She admitted forging the signatures of three grandparents and her sister to get her hands on the benefits. One of her grandfathers was in hospital at the time and has since died. She was sentenced after admitting 15 counts of fraud. 'When they spoke to her, she provided false details and gave her sister, Victoria Swanston's details. 'At . the police station, officers found her passport in her bag and realised . it was this defendant and not Victoria Swanston. She then admitted she . had attempted to avoid arrest. 'From . the police database system, it became apparent she was insured to drive . a Vauxhall vehicle, which was found in the Asda car park and the . registered keeper was her grandfather, George Swanston. 'He was spoken to and said she had taken it without his consent. 'She only had a provisional licence and Mr Swanston said he would not have let her drive the vehicle alone. 'She was insured to drive the vehicle on his insurance but only when she was accompanied. 'The defendant originally said she had driven the car with her grandfather's permission but he denied this was the case.' Gerry Scott, defending, said: 'The theft of the car was foolish and largely opportunistic. 'She had lost her job at the time and that has caused underlying difficulties. 'In terms of the obstructing PC, that was foolish but it didn't cause the police significant trouble. 'In terms of the taking without consent, their was a breach of trust but there was no bad driving or no damage caused to the vehicle.' The court was told that Swanston has 35 past convictions, many involving thefts from her family. The case was adjourned until next month for the preparation of a pre-sentence report. Swanston was bailed until that date."}

After Lydia Tillman, now 32, was attacked by Travis Forbes in Fort Collins, Colorado in July 2011, she suffered a stroke that left her in a coma for five weeks. Her jaw, wrist and ribs were also shattered. Her brother Jacob, who is hoping to raise $65,000 for reconstructive jaw surgery for his sister, has spoken of her inspiring positivity in the face of these appalling injuries. 'Lydia first spoke about Travis Forbes before she . was even able to speak,' he told MailOnline. 'She prepared a letter of forgiveness . that our father read out in court and she hasn't looked back. Scroll down for video . Fighter: Lydia Tillman, who was brutally beaten, raped and left for dead in July 2011, is pictured with her sister Esther Tillman after they ran a race together earlier this year . 'She refuses to waste her time angry at him. Lydia's amazing but we all feel that way. There is no point wasting any time or anger on him because he's gone for good.' Forbes, who was caught after his DNA was found under Lydia's fingernails, was sentenced to 48 years in prison after he admitted to the attack and the murder of another woman, Kenia Monge. Jacob, a skateboarder and artist, recounted getting the call about his sister's attack as he was near the Rockies, around two hours from where Lydia had slipped into a coma at a Denver hospital. 'It was terrible,' he said. 'My sister Esther called me as I was at a rest stop. She told me Lydia had been attacked and and raped and that she was unconscious. I drove there right away.' When he arrived at the hospital, he found his sister bloodied, bruised and with numerous tubes feeding into her broken body. 'She was so unstable they couldn't even take her off the temporary life support tubes to make her more comfortable,' he said. 'We didn't know if she was going to survive.' Injuries: Lydia suffered a stroke after the horrific attack that left her in a coma for five weeks. Her jaw was shattered and she was left with a broken wrist and ribs . After Lydia suffered a stroke, the doctors put her in a medically induced coma to control the blood clot that was in an artery in her neck, just inches from her brain. When she awoke after five weeks in the coma, she was unable to speak or walk. 'She was obviously the same sister I had known,' he said. 'You could tell she was obviously all there, but she couldn't speak at all. 'Even automatic sounds like laughing were silent - her shoulders jerked but there was no sound. She thought it was to do with tubes in her throat but it really was the brain injuries.' After a few more weeks in hospital she was moved to a physical therapy unit where she spent three months re-learning how to walk and talk - and despite the grueling battle, she remained upbeat. 'She was very, very positive,' her brother remembered. 'She definitely gets frustrated at times and angry that this has happened to her but mostly she's just really positive.' Hurt: Lydia is pictured walking back to her seat after making a statement at a hearing last year where Travis Forbes confessed to assaulting her. In her statement she said she forgave her attacker . Changed life: Lydia, pictured before the attack, had to learn how to speak and walk again with the help of physical therapy. Her brother said she still has to think before she can form a sentence . Speaking to NBC, her doctor  Rebecca Bearden added: 'I believe that Lydia shouldn't have . survived that day. She . went through so much and she probably shouldn't have made it but she . did, and it was because of her determination and her joy.' When Lydia left and moved in with her stepbrother and his family, she had mastered 10 words. She now lives independently and can say just as much as before the accident - with a little more effort. 'She's able to speak now but it takes a lot of concentration,' Jacob said. 'She knows what she wants to say but has to think about how to say it.' The next step is for Lydia to undergo a special reconstructive jaw surgery in January. It will help her with speech development but costs a staggering $65,000. Her insurance only pays for a procedure that would wire her jaw shut - a move which would reverse her speech therapy by stopping her from practicing words regularly, her brother said. Help: Lydia's brother Jacob, a skateboarder and artist, hopes to raise $65,000 so for her jaw surgery . Jacob, who is based in New York, is now trying to raise the money for the operation with his Still Kickin' campaign. As well as accepting donations online, he also plans to hold fundraising events. He has already received more than $24,000 from around 400 donations. 'She's really excited about this,' he added. 'She's moving on. She could have died but I'm so glad she was alive and that she could defeat this guy. She sees it that she won.' Lydia managed to escape the attack, which occurred after Forbes followed her home from a July 4 celebration, by jumping from a window and hiding until emergency vehicles responded to the fire. She ran towards an ambulance and when the paramedics asked whether she knew her attacker, she repeatedly told them 'No, no, no' before suffering the stroke. Unknown to her, Forbes had killed 19-year-old Kenia Monge and hidden her body in a freezer just months earlier. Killed: Lydia's attacker had murdered Kenia Monge, pictured, just months before. When he was arrested, he was walking a drunk college girl back to her apartment . Case: Lydia stands with Nash Gurule, the Denver detective in the Monge case who connected the attackers . A detective in Denver investigating the murder heard of Lydia's story and realised the attacker had used bleach in both cases. Authorities matched the DNA from under Lydia's nail to Travis Forbes, the suspect in Monge’s murder. A week later, he was arrested while walking a drunk college student home. He confessed to both the assaults after prosecutors agreed to not to charge him under the death penalty. He was charged with murder and attempted murder, and was sentenced to life in prison. Lydia was in a coma when he was arrested but later composed a statement to be read in court. 'Travis Forbes, you caused me no harm. My spirit, my soul and my mind remain untouched. May you find peace in this life,' it read. She added to ABC: 'It was my intention to find the strength in my heart to forgive Travis Forbes. I did. I felt extreme anger toward him, then I felt sad for him. He must be in so much extreme pain to so brutally hurt another human.' See below for video ."}
{"prompt": "Passengers will have to prove that their electronic phones, laptops and tablets do function at UK airports . British Airways announced tough new security measures last night which will see passengers barred from US-bound flights if their electronic devices are not charged up. In preventing passengers from flying, the airline is going one step further than the guidelines issued on Sunday. These stated that gadgets will be confiscated before boarding if their owner fails to switch them on and prove they are not packed with explosives. The US Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has said it will not allow mobile phones – especially the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy – on to planes bound for the US from some international airports if the devices are not charged. But British Airways’ rules could see travellers with uncharged electronic devices – some of which are notorious for having short battery lives – not only lose their gadgets but also their seats on the flight. And unwitting passengers whose batteries have run out during a stop-over, before taking a connecting flight to the US, face being stranded, unable to continue their journey. A spokesman from British Airways confirmed its new policy, telling the Daily Mail: ‘If [customers] are unable to power up their electronic device they will not be allowed to fly. If it does not power up then it cannot be placed in hand or hold luggage. We advise our customers to please do all they can to ensure that any electronic device they have is fully powered before you arrive at the airport. ‘For people transferring we advise that they use electronic devices sparingly if they are going to fly on a long journey before getting to London and then transferring on to a US destination.’ The airline also admitted that there will be limited charging facilities at check-in, so there is no chance of any last-minute powering up. The heightened security comes amid reports two terror networks are working together on a bomb that could evade existing detection measures. US officials are concerned that a mobile phone, tablet, laptop or other electronic device could be used as a bomb by Yemen-based Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and the Islamist Nusra Front, Al Qaeda’s affiliate in Syria. Scroll down for video . The new British Airways measures barring passengers whose electronic items cannot be powered on exceeds guidelines which state the item should simply be confiscated . In 2009 a Yemen-linked bomb maker, Ibrahim al-Asiri, built an underwear bomb used in a failed attempt to bring down a plane bound for Detroit. The TSA did not disclose which airports would be conducting the additional screening, but it was reported last week that passengers at British airports travelling to the US are facing extra checks on their phones. US officials singled out particular smartphones, including the Apple iPhone and Samsung Galaxy, for security screening on direct flights bound for the States from Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The BA spokesman added: ‘Safety and security is our top priority at all times and we continue to work closely with airports and governments around the world.‘ . We are complying with the US regulations and would advise customers to arrive in good time for their flights both at check-in and also at the boarding gate ... our flights continue to operate as normal.’"}

A wealthy British businessman and his wife have been found dead at their retreat in a remote Estonian forest. Philip Townsend, 55, worked for a mysterious Moscow investment company, where he was an analyst in the lucrative but murky Russian telecoms industry. Mr Townsend – who used the title Baron Townsend of Rathmore – and his British wife MaryAnne, 52, are believed to have been poisoned by carbon monoxide from an electricity generator at their secluded home. Police in Estonia released no details of the tragedy until contacted by The Mail on Sunday, and say they do not yet know whether the deaths are suspicious. Mr Townsend, who also owned a 16th Century manor house in Norfolk and a flat in Kensington, London, has been research director of Moscow-based Enza Capital since 2010. Four years ago another wealthy British-based tycoon involved in the Russian telecoms industry vanished from his opulent holiday villa in Latvia. Leonid Rozhetskin, 41, is presumed to have been targeted by an assassin. But last night the Townsend  family said they believed this latest  incident – which leaves the couple’s two children, Edmund, 17, and  Octavia, 15, orphaned – to be a ‘tragic accident’. Mr Townsend, who previously worked in London, is said to have typically spent the week in Moscow before returning home to Grade II listed Wood Dalling Hall, near  Aylsham, Norfolk, at weekends. He died in a converted barn, which he is thought to have bought and renovated last year. The house is three miles down a dirt track near the town of Valga in southern Estonia. Their only neighbour for miles, farmer Rein Rappo, 70, said he collected Mr Townsend from the Russian border on February 22  and drove him to the house. Mrs Townsend flew in from England the next day. Mr Rappo said: ‘On the evening of February 23 they were visited by a friend. I believe it was the man who built the house. I woke up at 4.30am and noticed their lights were still on. ‘At 10am a workman arrived at their house and he found their bodies. He ran over to my house and told me what he had found. He had seen Mrs Townsend’s body near the front door. Mr Townsend’s body was by the electricity generator.’ Secluded: Mr Townsend's secluded Estonian barn conversion, where he and his wife were discovered dead . When The Mail on Sunday visited the house daffodils and pink tulips had been left at the front door. The lounge, visible through the front window, appeared to have been left exactly as it was when they died. On the dining table was a half-empty bottle of red wine and two glasses, one half full, one empty. Also on the table was a pair of reading glasses, a handbag, a pair of leather gloves, a compass, a cigarette lighter and a book entitled Estonia: Cultural Tourism. A spokeswoman at Enza Capital declined to comment, saying: ‘We are not authorised to speak about his death.’ She also declined to give any information on the company. A source at Renaissance Capital, a respected investment company in Moscow, said: ‘None of my colleagues has ever heard of Enza Capital. We have no idea what this company is doing.’ Wealthy: Wood Dalling Hall, Wood Dalling, Norfolk, the 16th century home of Philip and MaryAnne Townsend . An Estonian police spokesman said the bodies were being examined by forensics experts and added: ‘No conclusion has been reached. There is no criminal investigation at this time. We are waiting for the post-mortem results. ‘If there is any evidence of foul play, we will investigate. Investigations at the scene show the building used an electricity generator, which was leaking gas. When officers arrived at the scene, they found the house filled with carbon monoxide.’ Mrs Townsend’s brother James Wilson, 49, a Norfolk farmer, said: ‘The children will be looked after by their relatives in Norfolk. The family request respect to be left alone to mourn this sad family tragedy.’ Additional reporting: Andrew Young ."}
{"prompt": "The Bad Santa’s Christmas sack is coming but this year it is not only the usual suspects who are feeling the big chill. By seasonal custom it is the humble basement bosses in the Premier League who check whether their P45s come through the letter box with the greetings cards. Now, if not facing festive dismissal quite yet, one or two of the big boys are beginning to sense that the skids could be under them. Yaya Toure, Raheem Sterling and Lukas Podolski looks dejected after a week of disappointment in Europe . Europe is the destination of choice for the major clubs but when Champions League matches go the way they have in the past few days these can be perilous journeys for the managers. Who would have thought, as recently as a week ago, that Manuel Pellegrini, Arsene Wenger and Brendan Rodgers would be planning extra helpings not of turkey and Christmas pudding but hard tack. Let us consider them in turn: . SENOR PELLEGRINI spent the latter part of this Wednesday evening confessing that his costly Manchester City have lost nerve, faith, confidence and, potentially most damaging of all for himself, trust. Just one win in five matches speaks to the truth of that self-wounding assessment and had that solitary victory not come against Manchester United then Pellegrini would be on even slipperier ground already. Manuel Pellegrini has won just one of his last five games as Manchester City have started to stumble . Seydou Doumbia (centre) did the damage with CSKA Moscow's goals in their 2-1 win over Manchester City . How far have the English champions fallen? As low as losing at home to a distinctly ordinary CSKA Moscow and having two of their prima donnas sent off during that humiliating process. Pellegrini answers to foreign owners who regard the Champions League as the Holy Grail. City captain Vincent Kompany looks disappointed at the end of the defeat by CSKA Moscow . City’s prospects of surviving a relatively easy group depend now on Bayern Munich, who have already qualified, either sending their reserves to the Etihad or treating that fixture as a practice match. Feliz Navidad, Manuel. MONSIEUR WENGER whiled away his Tuesday evening watching Arsenal throw away a three-goal lead at home against the Belgian lightweights of Anderlecht. The boos rained down in North London as he turned away from the scene of that debacle. The fans, let alone the directors, can see that this team are, quite literally, defenceless. Even the most respectful of former players are beginning to query why the manager has not bought top-class centre-backs. It looked as if Arsene Wenger would have an easy night when Arsenal went 3-0 up against Anderlecht... But the Arsenal manager could hardly look as his side threw away their three-goal lead at the Emirates . That question would be asked with greater urgency right now if Arsenal were not still in position to go through to the last 16. For the moment, it is being conveniently forgotten that Wenger’s esoteric ensemble would be scrambling to advance had they not been fortunate enough to pull a last-gasp victory out of a wretched performance at Anderlecht in the preceding match. As it is they are looking at second place, yet again, with its implicit danger of a deadly draw in the next round. And, like City, they have not started the Premier League season at all well. Arsenal pair Santi Cazorla and Lukas Podolski look dejected after throwing away a three goal lead . The Arsenal board are historically patient and respectful of Wenger, who achieved so much in his early years there. But for how much longer? Joyeux Noel, Arsene. MISTER RODGERS, meanwhile, splashed through only the first half of his sudden watershed on Tuesday. By scorning the highest European tradition with his decision to send a weakened Liverpool team into Real Madrid’s fabled Bernabeu, this manager has impaled himself on the imperative of his rested first-teamers defeating Chelsea at Anfield this weekend. Or at least avoiding defeat. If Liverpool lose this one – and slump even further adrift of the Premier League leaders – the carrion will make a meal of Rodgers come Saturday lunchtime. Brendan Rodgers made seven changes to the Liverpool side he sent out to face Real Madrid . If so, that feast will come early. Rodgers was so recently hailed as the saviour of Anfield that a descent into doubt this soon seemed impossible. He is bringing it in part upon himself. Far be it from a sportswriter to advise a manager to turn off the quotes tap but Rodgers really needs to put thinking time between brain and mouth. As an example of his tendency to damage himself, how about this cracker at the dinner in May at which the Uruguayan Dracula of the game was dubiously installed as our Footballer of the Year: ‘I am a better person for knowing Luis Suarez.’ In the end Rodgers and Liverpool only lost to the European champions by one goal . Nor, judging from his jocular appearance at subsequent training, does he understand even now the implications of a club of Liverpool’s European pedigree playing for damage limitation rather than glory at the Bernabeu. Among the chorus of disapproval, one Anfield legend asked: ‘What is the point of making qualification for next season’s Champions League the priority when you are playing Real Madrid this week?’ Rodgers, in training with Glen Johnson, appeared to be over the Madrid defeat at training on Thursday morning . That is not a question which will sit comfortably on his CV if ever he tries to pursue his professed ambition to manage in the upper echelons of La Liga. Worse still if Liverpool go out to – er - Basle. Merry Christmas, Brendan. Despite being held to a draw in Slovenia by the moderates of Maribor, Chelsea’s Jose Mourinho is iceberg proof this winter. Not only is he virtually certain of reaching the Champions League last 16 but Chelsea are top of the Premier League. Jose Mourinho is sitting pretty in Europe despite a midweek draw and his team are flying high in the league . However, the English game at large needs higher quality performances from Chelsea as much as from City, Arsenal and Liverpool... and Manchester United for that matter. This Champions League week – and not for the first time - has not cast the Premier League in a flattering light. Chelsea's Nemanja Matic celebrates his goal with teammates during the draw with Maribor . The best league in the world? Not even close unless the marquee clubs raise their game considerably, starting this weekend with Liverpool and Chelsea putting on a spectacle, Manchester City and United dazzling QPR and Crystal Palace respectively and Arsenal grafting substance onto style at Swansea."}
{"prompt": "(CNN) -- Mauricio Pochettino is the latest incumbent of Tottenham Hotspur's managerial hot seat. The London club have appointed the Argentinean after raiding fellow English Premier League outfit Southampton for his services. Pochettino guided Saints to their highest ever EPL finish last season and was credited with bringing through a talented clutch of youngsters at the club. The 42-year-old now has the task of guiding Spurs into the lucrative European Champions League, knowing failure could cost him his job. Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy sacked two managers in less than six months -- first Andre Villas-Boas then Tim Sherwood -- for failing to deliver a top-four place. In an statement on the club's official website, Pochettino said: \"This is a club with tremendous history and prestige and I am honored to have been given this opportunity to be its Head Coach. \"There is an abundance of top-class talent at the club and I am looking forward to starting work with the squad. \"Tottenham Hotspur has a huge following across the world and I have great admiration for the passion the fans show for this team. \"We are determined to give the supporters the kind of attacking football and success that we are all looking to achieve.\" Pochettino took over at Southampton in January 2013 with the club struggling at the foot of the Premier League and guided them to safety. This season he took them to their highest ever league placing -- eighth -- and helped develop a core of home grown talent including Adam Lallana and Luke Shaw, who are both expected to go to the World Cup with England. But expectations are much higher at Spurs, with a succession of managers being fired for not securing the top four berth that offers entry to Europe's money spinning Champions League. Harry Redknapp is the only manager in recent times to qualify for the competition, leading Spurs to the quarterfinals in 2010/11 before he was sacked in 2012. Andre Villas-Boas, the former Chelsea manager, finished fifth in his first season before being relieved of his duties in December last year with the club languishing in seventh. Tim Sherwood -- a former player at the club -- took over as caretaker but was sacked at the end of the season after Spurs finished sixth. Levy said in the club's statement: \"In Mauricio I believe we have a Head Coach who, with his high energy, attacking football, will embrace the style of play we associate with our club. \"He has a proven ability to develop each player as an individual, whilst building great team spirit and a winning mentality. We have a talented squad that Mauricio is excited to be coaching next season.\" Coaches Jesús Pérez, Miguel D'Agostino and Toni Jiménez have also followed Pochettino to White Hart Lane, with Southampton's search for a new manager now under way. In a statement on the club's official website announcing Pochettino's resignation, chairman Ralph Krueger said: \"We will be looking for a manager that shares our values, our principles and our philosophy. \"A manager who can continue to grow the First Team and build on our strong foundation -- a foundation led by an ambitious vision and plan that continues to build on our world-class academy, our amazing 129-year heritage and our excellent staff, and rewards our loyal and passionate fan base.\" Also see: Real secure 'La Decima' Also see: The $200M 'mistake'"}

The family of a blind stroke patient who died from pneumonia after being left outside in the pouring rain by bungling hospital nurses has received a payout from the NHS. Frank Kelly, 79, was wearing just his pyjamas when nurses 'lost him' and he was left in a car park outside Worcestershire Royal Hospital in December 2010. The retired farmer developed pneumonia and died three months later. His family have now received an undisclosed payout from the NHS after reaching an out-of-court settlement . Poor treatment: Frank Kelly, 79, died of pneumonia three months after nurses left him outside Worcester Royal Hospital wearing just pyjamas in the rain . Apology: Worcestershire Royal Hospital has apologised for Mr Kelly's poor treatment during his five-month stay at the hospital and his family has received an undisclosed payout from the NHS . They also received an apology after it emerged the incident was just one in a catalogue of errors during Mr Kelly's five-month stay at the hospital. The retired farmer was admitted to Worcestershire Royal Hospital in November 2010 after suffering a second stroke which left him blind. But the family soon took up a 24-hour rota at his bedside after being shocked by the 'appalling' care he received from doctors and nurses. On one visit to the hospital, Frank's son Martin, 51, found his father stood in the middle of the car park wearing nothing but his sodden pyjamas on a rainy day in December 2010. It later emerged he had wandered into the car park after the nurses who were moving him to a new ward lost him. Care: The family of Mr Kelly, . pictured being shaved by his son Matthew while in hospital, say staff were too busy to acre for their father and frequently failed to feed him . Dinner time: Mr Kelly's family visited him every day to feed him after being shocked at the 'appalling' care at Worcestershire Royal Hospital . Martin said: 'When I turned up to see my dad in the car park, I was stunned, I couldn't believe it. 'I stopped the car, raced over and told him I was there. 'It's so sad to think that he worked his whole life and when it came to it, he couldn't even get decent hospital care. 'We all believe that with better care we could have had dad home again.' In February 2011, just a few months after being left in the car park in the middle of winter, Frank died. Frank Kelly was admitted to the hospital in November 2010 after suffering a second stroke . Martin, from St John's in Worcester, . yesterday said the incident was part of a long-running series of . mistreatment that bordered on 'cruelty' and a breach of his human . rights. Martin and the rest of his family received a financial settlement from the hospital after one of Frank's own medical team advised them to take action. Martin added: 'He was not fed properly, they didn't seem to realise that he was blind. We had to take in food every day. 'He was dehydrated all the time and the communication on the wards was just appalling. We were begging for help but he was never given a chance. 'The hospital has admitted a total failure of care and that dad had an awful slice of the cake. 'We didn't do this for any financial reasons, we did it to try and highlight the failings and ensure this sort of thing does not happen to anyone else. 'We have been told it is improving but we are not convinced and we do fear what sort of care we would get if we were ever unfortunate enough to need them again.' He added that the health system had 'too many managers in suits' at the expense of nurses devoted to care. In a letter to Frank's widow Anne, 78, Chief executive Penny Venables said: 'I am acutely conscious that these improvements came too late to positively influence your father's experience and that is a matter of deep regret. 'I can fully understand how angry and frustrated you must have felt about the care he received at the time and how painful it must have been for you to witness his suffering. 'I have taken their concerns extremely seriously and am determined that standards across the trust will continue to be raised.

Maathai, an environmentalist, had long campaigned for human rights and the empowerment of Africa's most impoverished people. More than 30 years ago she founded the Green Belt Movement, a tree-planting campaign to simultaneously mitigate deforestation and to give locals, especially women and girls, access to resources like firewood for cooking and clean water. They have since planted more than 40 million trees. \"Professor Maathai's departure is untimely and a very great loss to all who knew her -- as a mother, relative, co-worker, colleague, role model and heroine -- or who admired her determination to make the world a more peaceful, healthier and better place,\" her organization said. World mourns passing of 'true African heroine' In 2004, she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts to promote sustainable development, democracy and peace. \"Her departure is untimely and a very great loss to all of us who knew her—as a mother, relative, co-worker, colleague, role model, and heroine—or those who admired her determination to make the world a peaceful, healthy, and better place for all of us,\" said Karanja Njoroge, executive director of the Green Belt Movement. Born in Nyeri, Kenya, on April 1, 1940, Maathai blazed many trails in her life. She was the first woman in East and Central Africa to earn a doctorate degree. In December 2002, she was elected to Kenya's parliament with an overwhelming 98% of the vote. She was honored by Time magazine in 2005 as one of 100 most influential people in the world. And Forbes listed her as one of 100 most powerful women in the world. In April 2006, France bestowed its highest honor on her: the Legion d'Honneur. Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki called Maathai a \"global icon who has left an indelible mark in the world of environmental conservation.\" Her passing elicited tributes from all around the world, like one from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in which he described her as \"a pioneer in articulating the links between human rights, poverty, environmental protection and security.\" He noted that she'd been active in his organization, including as a U.N. Messenger of Peace and part of a group trying to formulate global millennium development goals. Achmat Dangor, the executive director of the Nelson Mandela Foundation, recalled a 2005 speech that she made before his group in which she laid out specific steps that citizens, governments and businesses could take to protect the environment. \"We need people who love Africa so much that they want to protect her from destructive processes,\" Maathai said then. \"There are simple actions we can take.\" British Foreign Secretary William Hague called the passing of the \"charismatic figure ... a great loss to the world,\" and fellow environmental activist and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore recalled her as a woman who \"worked tirelessly (to become) a true inspiration for us all.\" And U.S. President Barack Obama said that Maathai's life-long fight continues, building off what she was able to accomplish and the minds and policies she was able to shape over her lifetime. \"As she told the world, 'We must not tire, we must not give up, we must persist,'\" Obama said in a statement. \"Her legacy will stand as an example to all of us to persist in our pursuit of progress.\" Maathai leaves behind three children and a granddaughter."}

The victims complained of stomach aches and diarrhea after eating pig organs bought in local markets since Thursday, China's Xinhua news agency reported. A local health official said initial investigations indicated that the pig organs were contaminated by clenbuterol, an additive that is banned in pig feed in China. Three people were detained for suspected involvement in raising and selling contaminated pigs, authorities said. Clenbuterol can prevent pigs from accumulating fat but is harmful to humans and can be fatal.

Tanya - who was a size 18 weighing more than 13 stone - was embarrassed at the prospect of facing the cameras on her sister's big day. She said: 'I’d been a bridesmaid before and I was massive because my daughter was only 11 months old at the time. 'When Anmarie asked me to be her bridesmaid I didn’t want to see pictures of me at that size again. 'I haven't got any pictures of me at my biggest because I hated having my picture taken. 'But I didn’t want to be scared of the camera at my sister's wedding.' Slimfest: The family slimfest was sparked by Tanya after Anmarie asked her to be a bridesmaid at her wedding . When Tanya joined a Slimming World class her 20-stone mum Jo and Anmarie, almost 12 stone, went along as well. The whole family, from Fairwater, Cardiff, cut out junk food, went on a healthy diet. And 24 stone club steward dad Tony joined in the family fighting the flab before the wedding last September. Tanya said: 'I had been a fat bridesmaid before and wore a size 18 dress. I remember having two dresses sewn together to fit me! 'I started my diet on 14 March 2011 and got to my first target a week before my sister's wedding. I had lost three and a half stone and felt so good. Slimming down: 24 stone club steward dad Tony is now 16st 8lb while his 20 stone wife Jo is now 12st 2lb and size 16 . Happy: After cutting out junk food, the family are now happier and healthier than ever before . 'I manage to rope my family into my diet and soon we were all losing weight.' Mother-of-four Jo, 53, said: 'Weight piled on when I started having children and I gradually got bigger and bigger until it was out of control. 'Trying to balance life and everything when the kids were little and trying to cook decent meals - sometimes you have to resort to fast food.' Jo, a stewardess at the same social club as her husband, said: 'We would finish work and get a takeaway. 'I got bigger and bigger and my health was poor and something had to be done, . 'Everyone wants to be around when their grandchildren are growing up and see them getting married off and I wanted to make sure I saw all that.' Slimmer sisters: Tanya (L) trimmed down by 4st 2lbs and Anmarie (R) by 2st 12lbs . Thanks to sharing ideas and tips the family has learned how to cook homemade food from scratch, using simple Slimming World recipes. And making sure that they snack on healthy fruit instead of reaching for a bag of crisps. Anmarie said: 'I always struggled with my weight after having my two daughters, and then I had my son and I felt massive. How they were: Thanks to sharing ideas and tips the family has learned how to cook homemade food from scratch, using simple Slimming World recipes . 'Before I was constantly choosing the wrong sort of food. The kids would come home from school and I’d put chicken nuggets in the oven.' And all because of the changes in their diets, they have now shed a stunning 21st 10lb between them. Tanya is now 8st 13lb and a  size 10. Jo is now 12st 2lb and size 16, Anmarie is 9st 7lb and size 10 and Tony is now 16st 8lb. Tony, 55, said: 'I’m so proud of all the girls and Jo looks brilliant. It’s good when people comment on how good she looks because I get a bit of a buzz.' The girls say that seeing how happy their mother since joining Slimming World has made it all worth it. Jo said: 'I feel absolutely fantastic, like a different person. I’m more confident, I feel like I did when I was a teenager. We all live a much healthier lifestyle. 'If anyone had told me three years ago that I’d be eight stone lighter now, I wouldn’t have believed them - and now look at me.' Sharing the experience: The girls say that seeing how happy their mother since joining Slimming World has made it all worth it ."}

The revolutionary Apple 1 has been signed by Apple computer inventor and co-founder Steve Wozniak, who designed and built the machine from scratch with his own hands in 1976. Produced by Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs, only 200 units of the Apple 1 were ever built - and originally dol for $666.66 . The first ever Apple computer which founder Steve Jobs sold from his parents' garage is expected to fetch £250,000  at auction. The Apple 1, the first ready-made PC to ever come on the market, was created by Jobs and fellow founder Steve Wozniak in 1976. The pair built 200 units in Jobs' parents garage in California, selling 50 to a local shop called Byte. How the Apple 1 works . The . eye-catching price-tag of the original Apple caused wild speculation as . to the reasons behind selling for $666 - the number of the Devil. But the number was classic Apple; it was design for the sake of it. Beauty for no reason other than because it looked nice. Steve . Wozinak once revealed: 'I simply like triple digit numbers with all the . things I'm involved with. The cost of making the Apple 1 was around . $540 or there about and we agreed on the best markup, retail price above . the cost of building it, which worked out to $666. 'Jobs . then tacked on the 66 cents to make it an eye-catcher price for the ads . with the sale and promotion publications of it to the public. As the . computer that gave birth to the Apple empire, including the MacBook, . iPod, iPhone and iPad, it is among the most prized Apple products in the . world. Only 46 of these original Apple machines are known to exist on the planet and only six are in working order - like the one that was sold. Auctioneer Uwe H. Breker from Cologne in Germany said: 'This is the sensational first product of today's highest valued company, . 'The Apple 1 is already a legendary milestone from the dynamic dawn of the personal computer age. 'This computer is one hundred-percent authentic and in fully-working condition. 'At the time it was first sold the machine was always delivered as a motherboard only. 'The peripheral equipment such as power pack, keyboard, monitor and cassette recorder had to be obtained personally by the user. 'Apple never offered a housing - every user had to make his own. 'The Apple 1 did not have an operating system, just a monitor-program, which provided the interface between keyboard entry, the computer memory and monitor exit. 'Any software system had to be loaded on cassettes.' The machine's main motherboard. Steve Wozniak was renowned for his neat designs, and his ability to create machines using fewer chips than any of the competition . The rare part of computer history is being sold with an original manual, software tapes which allow it to be run and a company letter from Steve Jobs. 'To date, the only two fully-working Apple 1 sets in comparable condition to the one were auctioned in 2012,' said Uwe. 'The first was sold by Sotheby's New York on June 15th for $374,500 and the second on 24 November 24th by my auction house for $640,000. The sale was held on May 24th by Auction Team Beker of Cologne, Germany. The Apple 1, the first ready-made PC to ever come on the market, was created by Jobs and fellow founder Steve Wozniak in 1976. The pair built 200 units in Jobs' parents garage in California, selling 50 to a local shop called Byte. They cost 666.66 US dollars although buyers would have been expected to cough up extra to add a monitor, keyboard and cassette player. The Apple machine has even been signed by Apple computer wiz Steve Wozniak, who created the firm with Steve Jobs in 1976, building 200 units in Jobs' parents garage in California . The Apple 1 came with a tiny 8K memory - around 600,000 times less than is standard with today's Apple computers. It would not even have the capacity to store one song. This example comes with all the original gizmos needed to make it run and is one of only six of the 46 surviving Apple 1s still working. It even carries Wozniak's signature on the motherboard, and also included in the auction is a company letter signed by Jobs. The machine runs on the 'Basic'  software system, which had to be loaded using a cassette. Only two working Apple 1s have ever . been auctioned; the first fetching around 241,000 pounds last year and . the second selling for a record 412,500 pounds just months later. Only two working Apple 1s have ever been auctioned; the first fetching around £241,000 last year and the second selling for a record £412,500 just months later . The Apple founders created the personal computer in 1976 and presented it at a Palo Alto computer club, but there were few takers at the time. Paul Terrell, owner of a retail chain called Byte Shop, placed an order for 50 of the machines and sold them for $666.66 retail - once Wozniak and Jobs agreed to assemble the circuit boards rather than offer them as kits. The pair then produced 150 more and sold them to friends and other vendors. Fewer than 50 original Apple 1s are believed to survive, with only six known to be in working condition. In a nod to the technology created by Jobs and Wozniak, potential buyers can even follow the auction online on their iPads. Uwe Breker, the auctioneer who sold the machine, said: 'The Apple 1 really is the symbol for the American dream. 'Two students had an idea, built and marketed it, and 35 years later it is the highest valued company ever. 'Steve Wozniak designed the Apple 1 computer, the first fully assembled computer kit, in 1976 and Steve Jobs took on the task of selling it. 'In Jobs' parents garage the pair built 200 Apple machines and sold 50 to a computer shop called Byte. 'The shop marketed it with the slogan 'Byte into an Apple' which gave Jobs the idea for the iconic logo we know so well today. The main board of the Apple machine, which is expected to sell for £250,000 . The gadgets comes with all manuals & certificates, making it a unique purchase . The heart of the machine: The 6502 microprocessor which powered the Apple 1, which was chosen because of its low cost . 'As with all Apple products the Apple 1 wasn't around long before a better model was launched, but a legend had begun. 'The rest is history. Apple is now the most valuable country in the world and interest in their early items only increased after Jobs' death. 'You couldn't actually do very much with the Apple 1. 'You had to load your program each time on a cassette and it only had eight kilobytes of memory - enough for only the most basic of word processing. 'From the 200 built only 46 remain but just six of them are working - and this is one of them. 'That makes it even more rare than it would be already - plus this one is signed on its motherboard by Steve Wozniak. 'This item was bought by a software company owner 30 years ago and when he saw our Apple 1 auction last November in which one sold for 640,000 US dollars he thought now was the time to sell.'

{"prompt": "(CNN) -- Jane Kean, who played diverse roles during a long career but was best known as Trixie on the TV revival of \"The Honeymooners,\" has died. She was 90. Kean, who lived in Toluca Lake, California, died Tuesday at Providence St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, her niece, Deirdre Wolpert, said Friday. She was hospitalized after a fall that led to a hemorrhagic stroke. In 2002, Kean told CNN that her work with Jackie Gleason predated \"The Honeymooners\" revival. They did vaudeville together decades earlier. \"As a matter of fact, we both -- I hate to say how long ago it was -- but we were doing one-nighters, the Loews Pitkin, Loews Melba,\" she said. \"I was the singer on the bill and he was the comic.

But Kean, who was born in Hartford, Connecticut, on April 10, 1923, was best remembered for her role as Trixie Norton when Gleason and CBS revived \"The Honeymooners\" in 1966. The actress who played Trixie in the classic black-and-white sitcom was Joyce Randolph. \"I had run into an agent when I went to see 'The Odd Couple' with Art Carney,\" Kean told CNN in 2002. \"And I was with my husband. And we drove back to California, and when I got back there, the agent called. ... So he said, you're not going to believe this, but you're going to be Trixie Norton.

Last year she did a two-hour one-woman show, a retrospective with film clips and everything. She was amazing.\" Kean is survived by Wolpert and her husband and their two children. Kean is also survived by a stepson from her second marriage and his family. People we've lost in 2013 ."}
{"prompt": "(CNN) -- Authorities in Chandler, Arizona, said they believe the gunman who held hostages at a restaurant is the same man who fled into a mall after opening fire on members of a crime task force. The man who surrendered at the Baja Fresh restaurant is not the federal fugitive that U.S. marshals thought they might have spotted earlier outside the Chandler Fashion Center, said Chandler Police Sgt. Joe Favazzo. After a thorough police sweep, the mall reopened later Wednesday, Chandler Detective David Ramer told CNN. \"We believe there is only one suspect here,\" Favazzo said. A woman who fled the restaurant, which is near the mall, told CNN she witnessed the man being taken into custody. Police identified the suspect as Adam Hernandez. Baja Fresh customer Leyda Schultz told CNN that a gunman held at least two employees after ordering customers to leave. Schultz said she witnessed the man being taken into custody shortly before 2 p.m. Favazzo said it was not clear whether the two were patrons or employees. The gunman apparently fired warning shots at the restaurant. Marshals and other members of a task force had confronted a suspect outside the Sears store on the west side of Chandler Fashion Center, said Arizona Department of Public Safety spokesman Robert Bailey. The suspect opened fire, and officers returned it, Bailey said. The suspect was being sought in an armed robbery, Chandler police said. The suspect entered the Sears, and the mall was evacuated and surrounded, Bailey said. A hostage situation was reported about 12:30 p.m. at the nearby Baja Fresh, he said. Favazzo said officers lost sight of the suspect in the mall. Marshals earlier Wednesday said the suspect seen at the mall may be fugitive Daniel Munoz Perez, who was mistakenly released last month. Marshals were trailing a vehicle known to be driven in the past by Perez, according to CNN affiliate KPHO. Perez is being sought for aggravated assault for allegedly shooting at a police officer in December, authorities said. According to U.S. Marshal David Gonzales, Perez was released from the Pinal County Sheriff's Office on December 16. The U.S. Marshals Service has been looking for him since. Perez is accused of shooting at Arizona Department of Public Safety officers December 11 outside a home in Casa Grande, according to KPHO. Perez, 25, was injured by gunfire in the shootout with the public safety officers, according to KPHO. He was admitted to a Phoenix hospital and was later held in another county's jail before being turned over to Pinal County, KPHO said. But the Pinal County Sheriff's Office said it never received the charging paperwork for Perez, and he bonded out on an misdemeanor warrant. The bond was $320, KPHO said, ."}

{"prompt": "Australia ordered federal police to take over security at the house of parliament Friday, a day after police conducted  one of the nation's largest counter-terrorism operations in the port city of Sydney. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said an urgent review of parliamentary security was ordered amid intelligence reports of \"chatter\" of potential threats by \"terrorist support networks.\" Meanwhile, several Islamic organizations in Australia sounded the alarm, warning about a surge of Islamophobia after Thursday's predawn counter-terrorism raids resulted in the detention of at least 15 suspects. \"Fair-minded Australians should not allow bigots and media shock jocks to undermine the cohesion within society,\"  the Grand Mufti of Australia said, according to a statement released by a group of Islamic organizations. Several hundred demonstrators peacefully protested against the police raids, some of them holding signs that said \"terror raids cannot break the spirit of Muslims.\" Among the suspects detained this week was Australian Omarjan Azari, who was later formally charged with conspiracy to commit terrorism. Azari was denied bail and is expected to reappear in court on November 13, authorities said. Police told CNN another 24-year old man was released on bail after being charged with possession of ammunition without license and a prohibited weapon. All other detainees have now been released, with two women issued future court attendance notices, police said. In an interview with Australia's Seven Network on Friday, Abbott said a senior Australian member of the ISIS militant group in Syria had been overheard instructing sympathizers in Australia to carry out acts of violence. \"Because we believed that a demonstration execution was likely quickly, we acted as we did to disrupt this particular network,\" Abbott said. Australian authorities estimate 60 citizens are fighting alongside ISIS and other militant groups in the Middle East. This month, Australia was quick to accept U.S. President Barack Obama's call for an international coalition to battle ISIS. Canberra announced plans to dispatch military advisers to assist the Iraqi military.  Australia is also sending fighter jets and combat support aircraft to the United Arab Emirates  to assist in the campaign against ISIS."}
{"prompt": "Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers thinks his team will be ready to challenge for the title again next season. Having run Manchester City a close second in May their chances of repeating the feat dipped after the sale of Luis Suarez, the introduction of half-a-dozen new players and injury to Daniel Sturridge. However, Rodgers' side have started to find their form - including a number of the summer arrivals - in recent weeks and Rodgers believes it is a sign of what they are capable of. He believes if they can win some silverware before then - they have an FA Cup fourth round tie against Bolton at the weekend followed by the second leg of the Capital One Cup semi-final against Tuesday - it will enhance their chances further. VIDEO Scroll down for Brendan Rodgers: Win the cup and then target league next season . Brendan Rodgers watched his side in training at Melwood on a cold Thursday afternoon . Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard was in good spirits as he joined his team-mates for a training session . Mario Balotelli fights off the cold and also a challenge from Jordan Rossiter . 'The reality for us this season was, could we finish in the top four? With so many changes we weren't going to challenge for the league,' he said. 'We were looking to win a trophy and then come next summer we will be ready to challenge for the title again. 'This year was about getting into the top four, trying to minimise the impact of so many new signings, giving them time to develop and target a trophy in the cup competitions. 'Emre Can, Mamadou Sakho, Philippe Coutinho, Raheem Sterling, Alberto Moreno, Javier Manquillo, Adam Lallana - all players who still have a lot to develop. 'The squad is looking exciting but needs that time to evolve. Liverpool defender Mamadou Sakho and young forward Raheem Sterling in training . Liverpool captain Gerrard shares a joke with Sterling and Jordan Henderson . 'If we can get success in a cup competition this year it will provide greater motivation and stimulation for them to stay together and perform. 'Along the way you have to bring in ready-made quality to help their growth. 'Come the summer time that period of integration should be complete and we can challenge for the title like we did last season.' Leading that challenge is likely to be midfielder Jordan Henderson, currently vice-captain but favourite to take over the armband when Steven Gerrard moves to the Los Angeles Galaxy at the end of the season. Rodgers would not confirm Henderson was definitely in line for the job but he did praise the 24-year-old's development in a leadership role. Italian striker Balotelli challenges his team-mate Glen Johnson for the ball in a training drill . Liverpool boss Rodgers gives £25m signing Adam Lallana some advice at Melwood . That was more than evident when he stood up to Chelsea striker Diego Costa both on the pitch and in the tunnel during Tuesday's League Cup first leg. 'When I first came in he was searching for his status at the club but the team who brought him in before knew he was a good persona and a strong character and that has continued,' added the Reds boss. 'Now you see his leadership qualities on and off the field; he will protect the team and his colleagues and he is a wonderful ambassador for the club. 'I felt by giving him the vice-captain he could carry that if Steven wasn't playing and he does it with great pride and honour. 'As a footballer he is still improving and developing and he will continue to do that. 'He was given the vice-captaincy role, that doesn't always mean that player goes on to become the captain. It is not automatic. Rodgers has seen his team's form improve of late and they are unbeaten in over a month . Lazar Markovic has started to make his make at Anfield after a slow start to his Liverpool career . Rodgers' side face Bolton on Saturday before visiting Chelsea for the second leg of the Capital One Cup semi . 'But certainly at this moment in time when Steven doesn't play he does it in great fashion. 'When you see him in the tunnel leading out the team he has great presence and good status and the supporters respond to him, . 'He is in a really good moment.' Looking to the future, Rodgers is hopeful of tying up the details on Sterling's long-awaited contract extension soon. 'It is something the club are speaking with his representatives on and I would think that would be concluded very imminently,' he said. 'The player is very happy. It (the delay) is nothing to do with Raheem, he wants to be here so hopefully we get the solution on that very soon.' Rodgers is still waiting for the even longer-awaited return from injury of Sturridge, who has not played for the Reds since August 31. 'We are still waiting and still working. He won't be available for the weekend,' Rodgers said."}
{"prompt": "(CNN) -- Bayern Munich dropped points for only the third time this season on Saturday as Borussia Dortmund held the Bundesliga's runaway leaders to a 1-1 draw at the Allianz Arena. Reigning champions Dortmund have beaten Bayern in their previous four league meetings but had to come from behind to steal a point on this occasion. Some tight defending by the visitors frustrated the home side in the first half, but the deadlock was broken in the 67th minute when Toni Kroos swept past two defenders before firing home a low left-foot shot into the right corner. The lead only lasted seven minutes as Mario Goetze put away a chance from a Marco Reus corner to put Dortmund back on level terms. Read: Footballers remember Christmas truce . Dortmund keeper Roman Weidenfeller kept Bayern at bay during the closing stages to earn his team a point. The draw keeps Jurgen Klopp's team in third place with 27 points and remain 11 points behind Bayern. Stefan Kiessling's 37th minute strike earned second-placed Bayer Leverkusen a 1-0 over Nuremburg to close the gap on Bayern to eight points. Fourth-place Schalke could only manage a 1-1 draw at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach and continue a poor run of form which has yielded just five points in six matches.

{"prompt": "By . Liz Hull . A toddler lost her mother and three relatives when their car crashed on the way home from a trip to the seaside. Holly Hind, 18 months, was the sole survivor when her great-uncle Martyn Pugh’s car was in a pile-up with a fuel tanker and a van. Her 28-year-old mother, Alison, Mr Pugh, 47, and his partner’s elderly parents, John and Margaret Kehoe, all died. Survivor: Holly Hind, 18 months, (left) was the sole survivor when her great-uncle Martyn Pugh's car was in a pile-up with a fuel tanker and a van, killing her 28-year-old mother, Alison (right), Mr Pugh, 47, and his partner’s elderly parents, John and Margaret Kehoe . They were returning home on the A44 in Mid Wales following a trip to the seaside at Aberystwyth. The road was named last year as one of the worst in the country for accidents and fatalities. Mr Pugh’s Ford Focus collided head-on with a Scania fuel lorry between the villages of Llangurig and Ponterwyd at around 3pm on Tuesday. The driver of a Ford Transit van that crashed into the back of their car escaped uninjured as did the lorry driver. But the four adults in the Ford were killed. Holly, who was strapped into a child seat, was airlifted to hospital in Cardiff. Although she suffered serious head injuries she is expected to survive. Her father, 36-year-old mechanic Steve Hughes, is at her bedside. The incident led to a 21-mile stretch of the road being closed for 12 hours. Scene: The 'dangerous' A44 in Powys was closed for 12 hours after the tragic crash . Yesterday Holly’s great-grandfather, Emrys Davies, 80, said: ‘The police came for Steve and he is in Cardiff with Holly in hospital. We are all just hoping she will be okay.’ Lynn Kehoe, 39, was last night said to be devastated. Neighbour Alan Crisp said: ‘She was very tearful. She has lost both her parents and her partner at the same time so we are all feeling for her. I have known Martyn for many years – he and his family are nice people.Martyn was the full-time carer for Lynn’s dad who was in a wheelchair and was quite ill. He was only able to go out if Martyn took him.’ Councillor Gareth Morgan said their village of Llanidloes in Mid Wales was in shock. He has called on the Welsh Government to carry out an urgent review of the A44, which is the main road from the Midlands to the west coast of Wales. Loss: Holly's father Steve Hughes, 36, pictured with Ms Hind is at his daughter's bedside in hospital in Cardiff . ‘It is a dreadful shock,’ he said. ‘I often saw Martyn with the little girl walking their chocolate Labrador. She is a lovely child. The accident was at a real blackspot, one of the most dangerous stretches of road in Wales. Fatal accidents have happened there far too frequently. ‘Accident statistics tell you in black and white that it is a very dangerous road; scenic but deadly. ‘The Welsh Government have made minor improvements to the highway but there is now an urgent need for a strategic review of that road, before more lives are lost.’ He added: ‘This will have a devastating effect on Llanidloes – we are a small community where we all care for each other. For four lives to be wiped out in an instant like this is very difficult to comprehend.’ Last night a spokesman for Dyfed Powys Police said that Holly remained in a serious but stable condition in hospital. He confirmed the names of the deceased and added: ‘Our thoughts and sympathies are with the family at this incredibly difficult time. ‘Next of kin are being kept informed and are being supported by specialist officers.’ The eldest child of Mr Hughes and Miss Hind, Ethan, six, was at school at the time of the crash. Tragedy: 18-month-old Holly Hind was rescued from the vehicle's wreckage and flown to hospital by air ambulance after a collision involving a fuel tanker and a van in Wales . Holly was flown south to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff and is today in a serious condition in hospital but is expected to survive. Her father is with her ."}
{"prompt": "At school I always bridled at teachers who referred to us as ‘young people’. Invariably they were icky groovers, smelling of toothpaste and piety. Yesterday the same rebellion rose in my gorge while watching a creepy Sky News-Facebook TV show that forced party leaders to matey up to selected yoofs. Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg, David Cameron and that Aussie from the Greens took turns to be quizzed. The programme, Stand Up And Be Counted (did they mean the ratings figures?), was all about ‘young people’ and their alleged indifference to electoral politics. The camera angles were look-at-me edgy, all wobbly with up-the-nose shots. Oh, please. Selfie: Ed Miliband (pictured second from left) poses for a photo with the Sky News/Facebook youngsters . The late-teen/early 20s inquisitors, pretty plainly politics obsessives, soon had Mr Miliband in trouble by asking what ‘life experience’ he had to be PM. Odd Ed should have said ‘more than you, wonkface’ or ‘It’s the middle of the day, why aren’t you festering in your bed?’. Instead he scrunched his lips and claimed, in that frogman-still-wearing-a-snorkel voice, that ‘ah’ve done a number of things’. He had been a Treasury spin doctor and had briefly taught (politics) at Harvard. That had given him ‘the ability, I hope, to engage and listen to people’. Normal 20-somethings would have treated this lame answer to hog-whimpering derision and armfarts. The political trainspotters recruited by Sky heard it in respectful silence. Mr Clegg, when his turn came, discarded his tie – hey, look, I’m a cool guy! – and went all glottal-stoppy and Northern English. His Pied Piper of Hamlyn act was embarrassing, belittling, wet – just like the programme. Public school-educated Cleggy started saying ‘coontry’ instead of ‘country’, ‘loonchtime’ instead of ‘lunchtime’. We had ‘kindof’ this and ‘kinda’ that, and he gave his sentences a California-surfer uplift. What a fraud. Yet the credulous boobies fell for it. Thus is our politics infantilised. Enter David Cameron. At least he and Ed Mil’ kept their ties on. He was asked what he thought about Prime Minister’s Questions (one of the so-called youngsters, who actually looked quite middle-aged, trotted out the Establishment view that rowdiness in the Commons is disgraceful). The late-teen/early 20s inquisitors soon had Mr Miliband (pictured centre) in trouble by asking what ‘life experience’ he had to be PM . Mr Cameron was also asked about the price of tampons. The show was fronted by Sky’s political editor, one Faisal Islam. Amazing to think this chump is successor to the serious, worldly Adam Boulton. In his shiny suit, the twinkly-eyed Islam could have been an under-manager at a boutique hotel. He kept mewing about what ‘young people’ were interested in. To keep the little darlings interested, the producers had laid on ping-pong, table football, a sweetie stall. Islam’s co-presenter Jayne Secker showed us these and even announced that there was ‘a break-out zone, as young people call it’. After the show Islam and Secker repeatedly told us how ‘extraordinary’ the programme had been. Right! The Greens’ Natalie Bennett, in her session, announced she wanted ‘peaceful political revolution’. Given that this involved encouraging more immigration and scrapping council tenants’ right-to-buy, it was open to question how peaceful such a revolution could be. David Cameron (pictured) was asked about Prime Minister's Questions - and the price of tampons . Nick Clegg (pictured right) discarded his tie and went all glottal-stoppy and Northern English. His Pied Piper of Hamlyn act was embarrassing, belittling and wet . But her views went little challenged. Ms Bennett said she had been a feminist since the age of five. Haven’t we all, dear? There was no sign of Ukip’s Nigel Farage. Apparently he was in Europe. Perhaps he had spotted a stitch-up in the offing. Instead it was Ed Miliband who was kippered, and not just with that excruciating piffle about his ‘life experience’. After his main session, he was pursued by a scruffy Sky hack who in a selfie-stick interview asked what Ed had done when he was 18. Our hero said he had been just like any other teenager, really: he had lived in New York with his Marxist-historian father, had ‘cared a lot about the world, been very interested in British politics and global issues’ – and had ‘drunk a bit too much’. Do we believe him? Is the problem with Ed Miliband not that, rather like the eggheads assembled at yesterday’s patronising Sky/Facebook stunt, he has perhaps never drunk quite enough?"}
{"prompt": "Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Libya's interim leadership gave residents in Bani Walid a 48-hour notice to leave the city as it sent reinforcements there and to the former regime's other remaining strongholds of Sirte and Sabha. As the National Transitional Council sought to assert control over all of Libya, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, Jeffrey Feltman, arrived Wednesday in Tripoli on an unannounced visit. Feltman met with NTC head Mustafa Abdel Jalil and Mahmoud Jibril, chairman and head of international affairs of the NTC, as well as with many civil society representatives. \"I am encouraged by these individuals and these organizations' efforts,\" Feltman said. His conversations centered on three points, he said. First, that the United States respects Libya's sovereignty and that the country's destiny must be chosen by its people. Also, the United States and NATO are committed to supporting the Libyan people as they chart their country's future, and that the United States seeks to create a broad relationship with Libya based on mutual respect and shared interests. \"What an incredible accomplishment it is that we can meet and speak freely today,\" he said, adding that Americans were \"inspired by (Libyans') courage and determination.\" Feltman is the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit Libya since the rebels took control of the capital. His visit was not announced beforehand because of security concerns, State Department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters in Washington. Meanwhile, al-Rai TV aired what it called a live phone call from Musa Ibrahim, a spokesman for ousted Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. The speaker told the channel that hundreds of \"the criminals\" (NTC forces) were killed at the gates of Sirte and about 250 of their fighters were killed at the gates of Bani Walid. \"We will continue to fight ... until we liberate all cities,\" he said. Al-Rai, which is based in Syria, has been pro-Gadhafi. \"Do not think that the battle is over,\" he said. \"We have prepared ourselves to lead a holy struggle for years if needed.\" In response to the latest Amnesty International report alleging Gadhafi forces committed crimes against humanity, he said, \"Most of those international organizations have no legitimacy and they have ... pro-imperialist and pro-colonization\" agendas. Earlier, al-Rai read a statement purportedly from Gadhafi that called for a halt to \"the terrorism and aggression of NATO\" in the town of Sirte, Gadhafi's birthplace. \"The terrorism and aggression of NATO in Sirte cannot be described and has no other similarity in the past or in the history of wars,\" the statement said. \"If Sirte is isolated from the world and this atrocity is committed against it, it is the world's duty to not be isolated from it. Therefore, you should take international responsibility and interfere immediately to stop this crime.\" Fighting was continuing. NTC Cmdr. Ahamda Almagri said his column of some 500 anti-Gadhafi fighters captured the military air base at Dirak and arrested two Gadhafi loyalists; some 70 other loyalists fled the air base, which is the second-largest such facility in the south. Earlier, anti-Gadhafi forces said one loyalist soldier was killed and three were wounded in clashes with the same column, which was moving in the direction of Sabha in the south. As of Sunday, NTC troops were patrolling areas south of Sirte to try to cut off supplies to pro-Gadhafi forces still controlling the town. The troops were sweeping nearby areas to prevent other pro-Gadhafi towns from offering Sirte aid. Al-Rai, a privately owned station, has in recent weeks taken over for Libyan state media in filling the role of Gadhafi's mouthpiece. The interim government was still struggling with the three Gadhafi strongholds that remained in loyalist hands. Abdulrahman Busin, an NTC spokesman, told CNN that the ultimatum for Bani Walid was issued late Tuesday and ends Thursday night. Previous deadlines were aimed at negotiating with the loyalists to give up the city. The new deadline warns civilians to evacuate before an offensive by the NTC forces. At a checkpoint about nine miles outside Bani Walid, families who had driven from the city complained of difficult conditions inside, including limited food and water. People also said they did not feel safe inside the city. Jalil has said his goal is to create \"a state of institutions, a state of law\" in Libya. He was justice minister under Gadhafi before defecting to join the opposition in February. Gadhafi's whereabouts remain unknown, although some of his relatives have fled to Algeria and Niger. On Tuesday, NATO spokesman Col. Roland Lavoie told reporters that intelligence was received \"confirming at various times in the conflict Gadhafi was clearly within the country, but for a while he has not given any sign of life.\" In New York, a draft Security Council resolution circulated Wednesday that would establish a United Nations Support Mission in Libya under the leadership of a special representative of the secretary-general for an initial period of three months. It adds that the mission's mandate would be to help Libya restore public security and order and promote the rule of law; undertake inclusive political dialogue, promote national reconciliation and begin the constitution-making and electoral processes. It would also help extend state authority, protect human rights, support justice and take steps needed to get the nation back on its feet economically. A vote on the proposal is expected within a few days. Speaking Wednesday in Zawiya, Jalil asked Libyans to unite so that \"the martyrs' blood will not be wasted.\" \"Unite yourself to stop all the strife and jealousy and all the differences,\" he said. The sacrifices that Libyans made during the revolution will be worth it; women, for one, will have a stronger political role, he said. CNN's Richard Roth, Kareem Khadder, Ben Wedeman, Phil Black, Raja Razek, Tracy Doueiry and Jill Dougherty contributed to this report."}

{"prompt": "(CNN) -- A \"faulty\" flight instrument contributed to the crash of a Turkish plane last month in the Netherlands, an accident that killed nine people and injured more than 60 others, Dutch safety authorities said on Wednesday. Turkish Airlines workers carry the coffins of four staff who died in the crash. On February 25, Turkish Airlines Flight 1951 from Istanbul to Amsterdam dropped from the sky on approach to the landing strip at Schiphol Airport, shattering into three pieces in a muddy field. Pieter van Vollenhoven, head of the Dutch Safety Board, said the instrument was one of the plane's two altimeters, which measure altitude. Because of the \"faulty\" left altimeter, the plane on automatic pilot reacted as if it were lower than it was and started to behave as if it was touching down. The plane was at 700 meters but the instrument indicated that it was at ground level. This caused the automatic throttles to slow the plane down, leading to a loss of speed. The plane was on automatic pilot when it crashed. Van Vollenhoven said there had been misty weather and if it were clearer then the pilots might have noticed how far up they were. He said that if such instruments don't function, automatic pilots should not be used for landings. Investigators said there had been faulty meter readings on two other flights but the pilots were able to land. Van Vollenhoven said that the pilots realized the problem but failed to appreciate what had been happening until it was too late. In the immediate aftermath of the crash investigators said the plane fell almost vertically to the ground indicating the aircraft did not have enough forward speed. The plane crash less than 500 yards short of the runway. Passengers described feeling the plane suddenly drop before impact, and at least one passenger said he heard the pilot trying to give more power to the engines before it went down. Four of the crew and three Boeing employees were among the nine people killed in the crash. Turkey's flagship airline is well-rated internationally for its overall safety record and the Boeing 737-800 has a good safety record. The last previous fatal incident at the Amsterdam airport happened in April 1994 when a KLM aircraft crashed as it tried to return to Schiphol shortly after takeoff."}
{"prompt": "(CNN) -- In a country with a flourishing porn industry and an annual penis festival, it may come as a surprise that an artist with a mission to make female genitalia \"more casual and pop\" has run afoul of authorities. But in Japan, a conceptual artist known for creating works inspired by her genitals is being held by Tokyo police on charges of sharing obscene material electronically. Megumi Igarashi, who goes by the pseudonym Rokudenashiko (which means \"good-for-nothing kid\"), launched a crowd-funding campaign to raise money to build a kayak in the shape of her vagina using a 3-D printer. In exchange for donations, supporters of the project were given data that would allow them to make their own 3-D prints of her genitals. Police arrested Igarashi Saturday, charging her with \"distributing data that could create an obscene shape through a 3-D printer.\" The 42-year-old denies the charges, saying that she doesn't acknowledge that the work is \"an obscenity.\" For her, it's a piece of fine art. In fact, Igarashi came up with the the idea for the project based on her own self doubt. Female genitalia is such a taboo in Japanese society, she explained on her fundraising page, that it has become \"overly hidden.\" She did not know what a vagina \"should look like,\" she said, and worried that her own was \"abnormal.\" Images of penises, on the other hand, were an acceptable part of pop culture, she said. (And anyone who's witnessed crowds licking phallic lollipops and sporting penis-shaped glasses at Japan's \"Festival of the Steel Phallus\" will find it difficult to argue with her.) The artist has embarked on a whole series of cutesy works inspired by the female anatomy, from smartphone cases to a giant kawaii mascot.

Many critics of her arrest have pointed out that Japan only banned the possession of child pornography a month ago, and even then, the ban excludes explicit anime and manga cartoons. Distributing uncensored images of real genitalia is a crime under the country's obscenity laws. More than 17,000 people had signed an online petition calling for Igarashi's release as of Wednesday. One of her lawyers, Kazuyuki Minami, acknowledges that not everyone will appreciate Igarashi's work, but says that her case is about more than artistic expression. \"Whether you experience empathy with her works that challenge a taboo will depend on the individual's sensitivity. However, all people who believe in freedom and equality of human beings should understand that her arrest and detention was not right thing.\" Police are still questioning Igarashi, a spokesperson for the Tokyo Metropolitan Police told CNN Wednesday. The earliest the artist can be released is August 8, although police can hold her for up to 20 days in order to gather evidence because she denies the charges, the spokesperson said. If convicted, she could face up to two years jail time or a fine of as much as 2.5 million yen (around US$24,500), her lawyers say. China to deport Tiananmen 'pork' artist .

A photo of officer Nick Ague carrying the 75-pound dog over his shoulder was posted to the South Londonderry Township Police Facebook page on Sunday getting more than 6,000 \"likes\" and 1,300 \"shares.\" In the comments people praise Ague's compassion for animals and thank him for his dedication. Despite the sudden Internet fame, Ague is \"keeping a level head,\" said fellow patrolman Scott Firestone. On Sunday, Ague responded to an accident involving at least one vehicle in Palmyra, the department posted on Facebook. Two dogs in the vehicle escaped. One was captured right away but Mya, the German shepherd, began running, Firestone said. Ague, himself a dog owner, gave chase. Mya and Ague continued running for about two miles, Firestone said. When Mya finally came to a stop, Ague realized her paws were injured -- presumably from running across hot asphalt and the rough terrain, the department posted on Facebook. Ague scooped up Mya up and walked her back to her owner's vehicle as a fellow patrolman snapped their photo. Firestone said Mya is at home recovering and doing well. He said Ague is taking advantage of the incident to add momentum to his continuing effort to start a K9 unit within the small police department. \"If you look on our Facebook page you can see we've searched for lost hikers and things like that,\" Firestone said, but \"by far this is the most attention anyone in our department has received.\""}

Both men had been warned about their conduct as fears grew that a fight would breakout prematurely. But they kept their cool to ensure their bitter rematch goes ahead on Saturday night. VIDEO Scroll down to see footage of Bellew and Cleverly's heated weigh-in . Nathan Cleverly and Tony Bellew continued their hostilities at the weigh-in on Friday afternoon before their fight on Saturday evening . The pair managed to keep the weigh-in civil without any violence but made sure they got in their last psychological digs at one another . Both weighed in under the cruiserweight limit in front of a capacity crowd in the resplendent St George's Hall. Unsurprisingly, their cheers were reserved entirely for Bellew with Cleverly on the end of a rather more hostile reception. Perhaps mercifully, three long years of talking is now at an end as Bellew bids to avenge his defeat to then world champion Cleverly. The Liverpool crowd was orchestrated by Bellew who clearly relished the limelight in his hometown for the weigh-in . Bellew soaked up the atmosphere before he hit the scales with the local Liverpool crowd showing their support for their man . The resplendent St George's Hall was packed with boxing fans to witness the weigh-in between local favourite Bellew and Cleverly . Cleverly received a hostile reception in Liverpool but remained focused at the weigh-in on Friday, weighing in just below the limit . Bellew weighed-in a fraction under the 200lb limit for the cruiserweight division ahead of facing Cleverly . They will next set eyes on each other ahead of the first bell at a sold-out Liverpool Echo Arena. 'It’s been a long time coming but tomorrow the talking stops. It’s real now and I’m excited,' Bellew told Sky Sports News HQ. ‘I talk a great fight because that’s what I feel. I’m the cruiserweight here, a manufactured cruiserweight against a fat cruiserweight.’ Bellew added: ‘I’ve waited long and hard in a 12 week training camp away from family and loved ones whereas he stayed in a dingy house in Wales. He (Cleverly) should have stayed and trained in London with Adam Booth. ‘You need more vision and desire than that. I have more desire than anyone in this division. This could be the fight of the year if he can absorb what I’ve got for him. Both fighters insist the talking stops now but they had plenty to say to each other during the weigh-in and had to be separated . ‘I’ve prepared to go to the trenches, I’m prepared to go to war. If not then it’s going to be a very short, sharp fight for him. ‘This is the defining fight in both of our careers. We will be remembered for Saturday night, simple as that. It will be a painful, brutal fight for him. It will be the end of his career Saturday night.’ Meanwhile, Cleverly had his say at the weigh-in: 'I’m very happy, it’s a good weight for me. Making the weight isn’t a problem and I feel good. 'I’m ready, I’ve had a great training camp, mentally I feel sharp and I should perform well. It’s the biggest fight of my life. It’s such a grudge match, a massive rivalry and it’s got personal. When I win it will mean the world to me and then I can move on to bigger and better challenges. 'It’s going to be a tremendous atmosphere. I really hope and I really think it’s going to be a great fight. Cruiserweight is chapter two for me and this is the acid test.'

{"prompt": "It has been described as part rock concert, part investment workshop. The annual gathering of Berkshire Hathaway shareholders is an odd mix. This year, former model Kathy Ireland joined Berkshire CEO Warren Buffet and the faithful crowd of more than 30,000 who attended Saturday's events. The attendees get the chance to learn about business and life from Mr Buffett and spend the day with like-minded investors. Special guests: Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett holds up the hand of former swimsuit model and now CEO, Kathy Ireland at a mini-golf competition at his AGM in Omaha . Kathy Ireland was a fixture in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue for 13 consecutive years with her last issue coming in 1996 after being on three different covers. But it's not just for her good looks that Buffet had her by his side. Since hanging up her swimsuit to dry, Kathy has been virtually printing money as CEO and Chief Designer of her company Kathy Ireland Worldwide which is reported to be worth some $2.0 billion. She has also written six books, including three for children and has a portfolio of real estate in Hawaii and California. Still got it: Former super model and now business woman Kathy Ireland and Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett follow Ireland's golf putting prior to the Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting in Omaha, Nebraska . The level of appreciation shareholders have for Mr Buffett becomes clear as he tours the meeting's 200,000-square-foot exhibit hall each year. Admirers held their cell phones and iPads in the air as they surrounded the billionaire Saturday morning. A pack of security guards created a buffer around Buffett as he visited displays selling Berkshire's See's Candy, explained BNSF railroad's virtues and highlighted some of the company's other 80-plus subsidiaries. Josh Miller, 11, of Maple Grove, Minnesota, couldn't see over the throng of people, reporters and cameras that moved through the exhibition floor crowd. But he knew who was at the center. 'Warren! Warren!' he called, holding up his iPad to get a shot of the Oracle of Omaha. Oracle: Investor Warren Buffett greets shareholders. No other annual meeting can rival Berkshire's, which is known for its size and the straight talking Buffett . At the See's booth, Buffett got a lesson in making hand-dipped bonbons. Then See's manufacturing manager Steve Powell got Buffett to autograph his white uniform coat. The Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting began humbly in 1982 with a crowd of 15 in an insurance company cafeteria. It has been growing steadily just as the company's stock price rose to become the most-expensive in the U.S., reaching $162,904 for a Class A share on Friday. Now the meeting regularly fills Omaha's 18,300-seat arena and every nearby overflow room. Buffett likes to call it 'Woodstock for Capitalists.' It's the one day of the year when the 82-year-old Buffett gets treated like a rock star while his friend Bill Gates, who serves on Berkshire's board, can wander through the crowd without much recognition. Kathy Ireland: After appearing as a model in 13 consecutive Sports Illustrated swimsuit issues, she now runs the brand product marketing company, 'Kathy Ireland Worldwide' Shareholder Larry Cundiff has seen a lot of change at the meetings since he started attending about 15 years ago. He said it's hard to get within 15 feet of Buffett now. 'I met him once at a meeting in - I think - 1997,' Cundiff said. 'I was sitting at a booth, and he just walked up and sat beside us in the next booth. He autographed a dollar bill for me. I don't think he even had security then.' Buffett again shared the stage this year with his 89-year-old business partner, Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, to answer questions from shareholders, journalists and financial analysts for six hours. The questions seemed somewhat tougher and more detailed because of the addition of a panel of investment professionals, including Doug Kass, who has a negative view on Berkshire's stock. But the bulk of the questions explored familiar themes, such as the future of Berkshire after Buffett and Munger are gone. The questioners also wanted to hear what the two men thought about the economy, the Federal Reserve and life in general. Buffett said he thinks Berkshire will continue to thrive after he's gone because the company's employees and managers will resist any attempt to change the way it runs. 'The key is preserving the culture, and having a successor as CEO who is smart and energetic,' Buffett said. The U.S. economy should continue growing at a steady pace just as it has since the fall of 2009, Buffett said, but the Federal Reserve's efforts to stimulate growth are likely to eventually create inflation. 'We've encountered far worse problems than we face now,' Buffett said. 'This is not our toughest hour.' Not everyone at the meeting was applauding Buffett. Outside, dozens of Utah coal miners picketed in the hopes of winning a better contract offer. A handful of environmental activists left disappointed after shareholders rejected a proposal to require Berkshire's utilities to adopt goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Bernie Morris, of Price, Utah, stood in the rain to hand out flyers Saturday morning. The 67-year-old said he's worked for the Deer Creek coal mine for 28 years, but fears he won't be able to afford the monthly health insurance premium the company wants to charge. A spokeswoman for the mine, which is owned by a subsidiary of Berkshire's MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co., said the company is committed to a fair solution but won't comment on specific proposals. But the protesters didn't deter the thousands of people who came to hear Buffett and Munger. Amaury Fernandez and his best friend Rick Cabrera said they had traveled to the meeting from Miami because Fernandez is interested in investing. 'They are two of the most remarkable men I've ever learned about,' Fernandez said. 'We don't know how much longer these gentlemen are going to be alive.' Jim Weber, CEO of Berkshire's Brooks Running company, said he has been reading Buffett's annual letters to shareholders since the 1980s - long before Brooks became part of Berkshire. Weber had even attended four Berkshire annual meetings before Brooks was acquired in 2006 along with Russell Athletic. 'If you're in the business world, it's a bucket list item. There's no other annual meeting like it,' Weber said."}
{"prompt": "LONDON, England (CNN)  -- CNN followed two die-hard football fans as they traveled to Rome to watch their teams battle to become champions of Europe. Ivan Papell partied until the early hours after seeing Barcelona win the champions League final. Ivan Papell is a Barcelona fan and managing director of the Spanish arm of a multinational company. He is in high spirits today after seeing his team beat Manchester United 2-0, but confesses to being a little tired. He didn't make it to bed until six o'clock this morning after partying the night away with thousands of other Barcelona fans, . \"It was a great night for Barcelona, but I've lost my voice from screaming,\" he told CNN. Manchester United fan Geoff Pearson is a Lecturer in Law at the University of Liverpool in England and lives in Manchester. He traveled to Moscow to see his team beat Chelsea in last year's Champions League final, but United were unable to repeat their success last night. \"We were outplayed, apart from for the first 10 minutes of the match,\" he admits. His match ticket cost him $106, but that only accounts for a small part of his expenses. Pearson couldn't get tickets for a direct flight to Rome -- instead, he had to fly to Milan, then hire a car and drive to Rome, where he stayed for three nights. In total, traveling to the final cost him about $750, but he does not regret making the journey. Manchester United fan Geoff Pearson doesn't regret traveling to Rome, despite seeing his team lose. \"The atmosphere at the match was brilliant,\" he told CNN. \"The Manchester United fans did themselves proud. They outnumbered the Barcelona fans and made more noise.\" How much have you paid to see your team play abroad? Sound Off below . While Pearson was impressed by the atmosphere inside Rome's Stadio Olimpico, he says he and other traveling Manchester United fans had difficulty getting to the match. He says the fans' bus was delayed up by police and that there was a crush to get through the turnstiles into the stadium, putting it down to \"the usual chaos of Italian away matches.\" Papell had no such trouble getting to the game and, sitting with Manchester United fans, he says he was impressed by their sporting behavior. He says that many United fans congratulated him after the match, telling him Barcelona had deserved to win. After seeing Barcelona beat the reigning European Champions Papell was justifiably proud of his team's performance. \"Barcelona were lucky to have scored first, but after that it was the sort of match Barcelona wanted. Manchester United were always behind the ball and Barcelona dominated the game,\" he said. \"I was expecting more from Manchester United but Barcelona can play the ball very fast and they make it hard for other teams.\" While Papell catches up on some sleep, Pearson has to catch a train to Milan this afternoon, before flying back to England tomorrow morning. \"It was definitely worth it,\" he said. \"It was a European final and they don't come round every year.\" But if the United and Barcelona do make it to next year's final, Pearson and Pappell will no doubt be in Madrid to cheer them on."}

But the French golfer was more relieved to have ended a two-year wait for a European Tour title, especially with a new member of the family on the way. \"That is very tiring but I am really, really happy,\" he said after winning a nine-hole playoff at the Spanish Open on Sunday, the equal longest decider in the tour's 41-year history. The 38-year-old clinched his fourth European Tour win, and first since triumphing at the 2011 Sicilian Open, having been tied with Chile's Felipe Aguilar and Germany's Maximilian Kieffer after the 72 regulation holes. Aguilar, also 38, bowed out at the third extra hole, and the other two matched each other par for par in the next five. Jacquelin finally broke the deadlock with a wedge to five feet, sinking the birdie putt to deny 22-year-old Kieffer his maiden top-level victory and claim the â‚¬250,000 ($327,000) first prize. It should lift the 146th-ranked player inside the top 100. \"I could not make any putts (in the play-off) but the last one dropped, which means a lot for me and my family,\" Jacquelin said on the European Tour website after taking his career earnings past â‚¬9 million ($11.8 million). \"There's another baby coming at the end of November; every time I get a baby, there's a win so I'll have a football team after a few years!\" Scotland's Marc Warren had led for most of the final day, but four bogeys in his last five holes meant he finished in a tie for fourth -- one shot away from making the playoff as he was left to rue a three-putt at 18. Sergio Garcia tied for 12th at his national event, having flown from Augusta after finishing eighth at the Masters last Sunday. Miguel Angel Jimenez, playing his first tournament since breaking his leg in a skiing accident last year, missed the halfway cut along with former major champions Michael Campbell and Jose Maria Olazabal."}
{"prompt": "Walter Smith will end his self-imposed Ibrox exile on Tuesday night - after admitting that he elected to stay away from Rangers games while the battle raged for control of the troubled club.

Smith handed the managerial reins to McCoist in 2011, but returned to the club as chairman in May 2013 only to quit less than three months later following a period of bitter in-fighting. Explaining his non-attendance at matches since quitting as manager and then as chairman, the former Scotland boss said: ‘At first I didn’t go because I didn’t want people thinking I was - not interfering, exactly - but going to watch Alastair (McCoist) and the other boys I’d left there. That was initially my main reason for not going back. ‘But when (former chief executive) Charles Green asked me to go on the board I went back and going to games was another aspect of (the role). ‘But since I left the board, the reason I don’t go back is because is everybody keeps saying to me: ”You are supporting that side; or you are supporting the other side.” I thought: “I’m better off not bothering going.” Ally McCoist (near) was Smith's assistant when he was in charge of Rangers .

Brazil will not grant asylum to NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, a local newspaper reports. Yesterday, Snowden released an open letter addressed 'to the people of Brazil' where he offered to help the South American nation investigate US spying on their soil, but that in order to do so, he needs to be granted political asylum. However, the Brazilian government has no interest in investigating the information revealed by Snowden in June and does not intend to give him asylum, government officials were quoted as saying in Sao Paolo paper Folha de S.Paul. Scroll Down for Video . Hard sell: Edward Snowden has previously sought asylum in Brazil and now is trying to get the public on his side by writing an open letter, describing how he would be able to help in their fight against surveillance . Snowden's lengthy letter said that . he's been inspired by the global debate ignited by his release of . thousands of National Security Agency documents, and that the NSA's . culture of indiscriminate global espionage 'is collapsing.' In . the letter, released widely online, Snowden commended the Brazilian . government for its strong stand against spying and wrote that he would . aid them in investigating claims that Brazil is one of the victims of . NSA - if they give him asylum. However, several Brazilian politicians, mainly opponents of Rousseff's leftist government, said granting Snowden asylum would be counter-productive and would lead to further deterioration of ties with the United States, the country's largest trading partner after China. Revelations about the NSA's spy programs were first published in June, based on some of the thousands of documents Snowden handed over to the Brazil-based American journalist Glenn Greenwald and his reporting partner Laura Poitras, a U.S. filmmaker. The documents revealed that Brazil is the top NSA target in Latin America, spying that has included the monitoring of Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff's cellphone and hacking into the internal network of state-run oil company Petrobras. The revelations enraged Rousseff, who in October canceled an official visit to Washington that was to include a state dinner. She's also pushing the United Nations to give citizens more protections against spying.Handle . Offended: Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff has blasted President Obama and cancelled a state visit to America over the revelations of how records of her personal cell phone calls were collected . In his letter, Snowden dismissed U.S. explanations to the Brazilian government and others that the bulk . metadata gathered on billions of emails and calls was more 'data . collection' than surveillance. 'There . is a huge difference between legal programs, legitimate spying ... and . these programs of dragnet mass surveillance that put entire populations . under an all-seeing eye and save copies forever,' he wrote. 'These programs were never about terrorism: they're about economic spying, social control, and diplomatic manipulation. They're about power.' Brazilian senators had asked for Snowden's help during hearings about the NSA's targeting of Brazil, an important transit hub for trans-Atlantic fiber optic cables that are hacked. Both Greenwald and his domestic partner David Miranda spoke before the senate, and Miranda has taken up the cause of persuading the Brazilian government to grant political asylum to Snowden. Snowden, who is living in Russia on a temporary one-year visa, previously requested political asylum in Brazil and several other nations. On Tuesday, neither Brazil's Foreign Ministry nor the presidential office said they had immediate comment on Snowden's letter or any pending asylum request. 'Six months ago, I revealed that the NSA wanted to listen to the whole world,' Snowden wrote. 'Now, the whole world is listening back, and speaking out, too. Trying to help: Journalist Glenn Greenwald and his Brazilian partner have taken up Snowden's case and have lobbied the Brazilian government, to no avail at this point . â€˜The culture of indiscriminate worldwide surveillance, exposed to public debates and real investigations on every continent, is collapsing.' Several members of Brazil's congress have called for Snowden to receive asylum, so that he could assist lawmakers' investigation into NSA activity in Brazil. Rousseff recently joined Germany in pushing for the United Nations to adopt a symbolic resolution which seeks to extend personal privacy rights to all people. The Brazilian leader has also ordered her government to take several measures, including laying fiber optic lines directly to Europe and South American nations, in an effort to 'divorce' Brazil from the U.S.-centric backbone of the Internet that experts say has facilitated NSA spying. The Snowden letter was first published Tuesday in a Portuguese translation by the Folha de S. Paulo newspaper. The AP later obtained the original English version. It comes one day after a U.S. district judge ruled that the NSA's bulk collection of millions of Americans' telephone records likely violates the U.S. Constitution's ban on unreasonable search. The case is likely to go to the Supreme Court for a final decision."}

So when the Hunter Valley mother-of-two heard the New South Wales government was for the first time acknowledging miscarried children by giving parents the option to obtain a certificate of recognition for their loss, she was over the moon. Ms Tattis has had five miscarriages and lost a set of twins just days after they were born. Scroll down for video . Toni Tattis, 38, has had four miscarriages and lost two sets of twins just days after they were born. She is pictured here with her 'miracle baby' Isabella (pictured with Ms Tattis above) who is now 9 years old . Drawing from these experiences, she is now helping other parents cope with their grief. The now 38-year-old lost a baby boy at 11 weeks in May 2001 when she was 25 years old. This child, who she later named Rhys, was her first miscarriage. In November of the same year she lost baby Jordyn at nine weeks and then in April 2002 her dreams of becoming a mother slipped away again when she lost a set of twins, Cooper and Kaitlyn. Heartache returned in May 2004 when baby James passed away five weeks after she fell pregnant. Amid these tragedies, Ms Tattis gave birth to twins Jacinta and Madelin - only to lose them after they were born in November 2003. Jacinta lived for two hours and Madeline passed away after three days. They were born 24 weeks into Ms Tattis' pregnancy. She has since had two healthy children, 'miracle baby' Isabella, 9, who was born in 2005 and Arlie, 19 months, in 2013. Her girls, Jacinta and Madelin, died in November 2003 . Her first husband, Tim Tattis, is the father of Isabella and her lost babies, and her fiance Warren Cooke is father to Arlie. 'For me, my very first loss on its own was quite devastating and distressing for me because I didn't know anyone who had experienced loss [like this],' Ms Tattis, who lives in the Hunter Valley, told Daily Mail Australia. 'All my sisters had healthy pregnancies and I was the oldest. 'The main thing I felt was very lonely and isolated, and there were no online support groups - in essence - I had to deal with it on my own.' To add to her times of grief, Ms Tattis said some of her friends did not see her loss as a real loss. She stressed her close family and friends were very understanding and helped her cope with the death of her children. 'Miscarriage loss is looked at by quite a few people as not quite a big deal, it's not a baby that you've lost,' Ms Tattis said. 'That expectation that parents should move on quickly, that doesn't happened in reality. 'You can't just switch a button and say it's all good. That puts a lot of pressure on us, and they do feel that loneliness and isolation. The names of her lost children - Rhys, Jordyn, Cooper, Kaitlyn, Jacinta and Madeline and James - are in a framed picture as she remembers them every day. She would grief for them forever . Keepsakes from her twins, Jacinta and Madeline, are two teddies sitting on the two quilts they lay on in hospital . '[Some people] think we weren't really attached these babies so early into the pregnancy, but the love and the future are all embedded in them and is there from the moment we find out about the baby. 'The big issue is that there's still a perception that these babies aren't real babies, they're not treated as a full-term birth. They are different. 'But a loss is a loss and I don't know why we need to minimise it this much. They have a beating heart and you can't question that.' Despite it being a few years since the deaths of her children, Ms Tattis said she would spend her whole life grieving for them. 'We invest in these [miscarried] babies... and when they are taken from you it doesn't make a difference when the pregnancy is lost. 'I will always be a mum to these babies and I will carry them in my heart forever. 'Even though I'm living my life, I never forget their birthdays. There is always something special I usually do for them on their birthday like I do for my two living children because they are my children.' Fortunately Ms Tattis now has two children named Arlie, 19 months, and Isabella, 9. On the left, Ms Tattis is pictured with her children and fiance Warren Cooke who is Arlie's father . Ms Tattis (again pictured with daughter Isabella) is also co-founder and vice-president of Bears of Hope - a group dedicated to helping grieving parents who lose a child . From her first-hand experiences, Ms Tattis knew the New South Wales government's move to introduce certificates of recognition for miscarriages would help grieving parents cope with the death of their child. '[When I heard] I was absolutely ecstatic, I was so emotionally overwhelmed. I wish it was available to me back then,' she said. 'This validation and acknowledgement from the government is going to shape the perception among the community and help those families grieving for their baby. 'Acknowledgement goes a long way helping parents heal and work through their grief. 'To be able to speak of their name and acknowledge their life is music to the ears of their parent.' Ms Tattis has welcomed the NSW government's move to introduce a certificate of recognition for miscarriages . Ms Tattis said naming her lost children had helped her move forward with her life. 'When I did I felt a big weight come off my shoulders... I wish I had done it in the beginning,' she said. The move from NSW comes after Queensland, South Australia and the Northern Territory have done the same. The certificate of recognition was introduced just before Christmas last year but Attorney-General Brad Hazzard made the announcement on Monday. A miscarriage involves a child that is carried for less than 20 weeks and is below 400 grams. 'Families who experience the loss of a baby early in a pregnancy have a difficult grieving process and often feel that their loss isn't recognised,' Mr Hazzard said. ;Until now it has not been possible to receive formal recognition for the loss of a pregnancy before 20 weeks. 'At the request of the Government, NSW Registry of Births, Death and Marriages are issuing optional recognition certificates to parents who have experienced this tragedy. 'The recognition certificates are not legal documents but it is hoped that, at least in some small way, a formal recognition certificate will help.' It is also available to parents who lost a child before the introduction date. Partnered with raising her two children, Ms Tattis is also co-founder and vice-president of Bears of Hope - a group dedicated to assisting parents to deal with their miscarriage. 'What has helped me through the years of loss, loneliness and depression [is] having the opportunity to speak about my babies with other bereaved parents, co-founding and managing Bears Of Hope and writing children's books,' she said. 'Turning the absolute heartache into helping others has been beneficial in my own healing.'"}

{"prompt": "Washington (CNN) -- Will an anti-incumbent wave return Republicans to power in the House and Senate, or can Democrats engineer a late rush to hold on to their congressional majorities? The 2010 mid-term elections comes down to campaign basics in the final nine days until vote-counting begins. For now, the two parties agree that Republicans will win more seats than they currently hold, but they differ sharply on how many and whether a major power shift will occur. Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" program that an unprecedented GOP wave would win control of both chambers as well as state legislatures in a broad condemnation of President Barack Obama and Democratic policies. \"The voters are tired of the fact that the federal government has not listened to them over the past two years, has moved in its own direction, at its own rhythm and they want to pull back on that,\" Steele said. \"And I think you're going to see a wave, an unprecedented wave on election day that's going to surprise a lot of people.\" His Democratic counterpart, former Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine, pointed to strengthening poll numbers for his party's candidates as a sign that the Democratic base was getting energized. \"From this point forward, it's all about turnout and ground game, and we're seeing good early voting trends,\" said Kaine, the Democratic National Committee chairman, when asked on the ABC program \"This Week\" if Democrats can hold their majorities. \"We've got work to do, but we think we can do it.\" While Kaine said the House remains uncertain, he sounded much more confident about the Senate. \"Four or five months ago, the Republicans thought they had a great chance at taking both houses,\" Kaine said. \"For a variety of reasons, the Senate has gotten much more difficult for them. And again, we're seeing this week strong moves in polling for our Senate candidates\" in several states. One of those reasons is inexperienced, conservative ideologues backed by the Tea Party movement who defeated mainstream Republicans in primary elections and now trail Democratic foes as the November 2 vote approaches. The Delaware race is a prime example. Christine O'Donnell's primary win over nine-term Republican Rep. Mike Castle made a Senate seat once considered likely Republican now an apparent Democratic victory for previously little-known Chris Coons. O'Donnell's campaign became a national joke over a long-ago comment that she once \"dabbled in witchcraft\" and other missteps. It also exposed a rift within the political right between the mainstream Republican establishment, which criticized O'Donnell and other Tea Party backed candidates, and the more conservative Tea Party movement. With the election approaching, Republicans put on a united front Sunday, with GOP strategist Karl Rove -- one of O'Donnell's harshest critics -- calling the Tea Party movement \"patriotic\" and \"incredibly positive.\" While noting that Tea Party backers \"are not people who are skilled in the ways of Washington,\" Rove told the CBS program \"Face the Nation\" he welcomed the movement as a \"wholesome development\" that would greatly increase Republican turnout in a mid-term election. Rove predicted Republicans will win well over 50 House seats to easily grab majority control of the chamber, and that a GOP Senate majority also was possible. On the same program, Democratic Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland predicted a different outcome, due to voter distrust of what he called special interest money going for anonymous donations to groups running attack ads against Democratic candidates. The issue hammered by Democrats including Obama in recent weeks was proving resonant, Van Hollen said. \"I'm confident the Democrats are going to retain their majority because the American people are connecting the dots between these tens of millions of dollars of secret special interest money,\" he said, later adding: \"The early voting states are showing good news for the Democrats.\" Both Rove and Steele said election disclosure laws should be changed, but added that the anonymous donations to groups running political ads complied with current law. Rove added that Democrats including Obama benefited from similar anonymous campaign funding in the past."}
{"prompt": "By . Belinda Robinson . Death: Habib Ullah, 39, died after being restrained by up to five police officers during a drugs search in High Wycombe . Five police officers will face gross misconduct hearings but no criminal charges over the death of a man who collapsed after being restrained during a drugs search. Habib Ullah, 39, died after he was forced to the ground in a car park in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire in 2008 by police who believed he was hiding class A drugs in his mouth. Officers alleged that he refused to reveal a package of drugs hidden in his mouth. When a struggle followed, he collapsed. After an inquest into his death, the CPS decided that there was not . enough evidence for charges of manslaughter by gross negligence, . misconduct in public office, perjury and perverting the course of . justice. But the officers from Thames Valley . Police could face the sack after the Independent Police . Complaints Commission (IPCC) found grounds for gross . misconduct because the police gave different statements to the coroner and the IPCC. Today, his distraught relatives reacted with fury as prosecutors decided not to bring charges in the case. Mr Ullah's sister Nasrit Mahmood said: . ‘We are not happy that the CPS has decided not to charge those police . officers who are responsible for Habib's death.’ In 2008, an initial inquiry into Mr Ullah's death was conducted by the Independent Police Complaints Commission, but it was not referred to the CPS. Two years later, Mr Ullah’s girlfriend Emma . Forbes told a court that up to five officers restrained him as they . tried to force the package out of his throat, including one officer who . shouted ‘break his arm’. In 2011, the case was re-opened and new evidence emerged during police officers' accounts of what had taken place. The . investigation also looked at further opinion from restraint experts and . doctors. But the inquest was abandoned after concerns were raised about . the difference in statements the police had given to the coroner and . what they had previously told the IPCC. The Solicitors Regulation Authority is also considering the conduct of a Police Federation solicitor in . relation to Mr Ullah's death. Family man: Habib Ullah is pictured with his wife and two of his children before his death . Mr Ullah's sister Nasrit Mahmood added: ‘At the inquest they are caught out withholding evidence in front of everyone including the judge and jury. 'We have evidence of police cover-ups, so not only is it my opinion that they caused my brother's death but these police officers have not given a full and truthful account. 'How on earth can CPS disregard the facts? ‘This sadly shows that the CPS together with the IPCC are only there to protect and cover up police crimes. ‘Their decision has only shown their true colours but made us much stronger. ‘This is not justice for us and we will not give up until justice is served and that is a promise.’ Thames Valley Police Headquarters: The officers, from Thames Valley Police, could face the sack as watchdog the Independent Police Complaints Commission found grounds for gross misconduct . Guido Liguori, IPCC Associate Commissioner, said: ‘This has been a complex investigation which as we have said has taken an unbearably long time for Mr Ullah's family. ‘I am very sorry for the prolonged distress this has caused, but it has been essential to ensure that our investigation was robust and thorough. ‘Five officers and a solicitor were interviewed under caution and we felt there was sufficient evidence to refer to the CPS. 'In light of the CPS decision, we have now sent the report to the family of Mr Ullah and the SRA. 'In accordance with procedures under the Police Reform Act 2002 Thames Valley Police were sent a copy of the report in January 2014 and they have determined that five officers should now face gross misconduct hearings. 'We have also sent a copy of the report to the Coroner in advance of the inquest into Mr Ullah's tragic and untimely death.’ A spokesman for the CPS added that it was unable to establish a causal link, to the criminal standard, between the conduct of Thames Valley Police officers and Mr Ullah's death. They also questioned whether alterations made to their statements were intended or able to pervert the course of justice. He said: ‘The case has been thoroughly reviewed in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors.' ‘We carefully examined the evidence in this case, including evidence provided by experts in pathology, emergency medicine and policing techniques and accounts from eyewitnesses.’ ‘Since there is insufficient evidence to give rise to a realistic prospect of convicting any person of any criminal offence arising from the circumstances of Mr Ullah's death, we have advised the IPCC that no further criminal action should be taken. ‘Our thoughts remain with Mr Ullah's family at this difficult time for them and we fully understand that this is not the decision they will have wanted. 'We have written to them to explain our decision in detail and have offered to meet with them to discuss this matter should they so wish.’"}
{"prompt": "Paris (CNN) -- Dressed in a wet suit, air tanks strapped to his back, poised to head overboard is an image of Jacques Cousteau most people would recognize. It was a routine the French explorer and conservationist repeated over and over again, hundreds, perhaps thousands of times over his long and adventure-filled life. But less known was that Cousteau was an inventive genius. \"I remember most that he was enchanted with ideas ... He was almost like a little child, but he was the most creative and imaginative person I've ever met,\" says Susan Schiefelbein, a close collaborator with Cousteau for more than two decades who also helped him write his autobiography. \"He made connections that other people were slow to make. A scientist who would be involved and have a passion in his work could go to Cousteau and say 'A,B' and Cousteau could skip to 'Q' and understand immediately the intermediary steps,\" she said. The Frenchman practically invented scuba diving when he developed the regulator valve that made possible breathing air from tanks underwater. Apart from his scuba equipment, which he called an \"aqua lung,\" Cousteau was perhaps best known for his underwater photography. His stunning documentaries produced for television and cinema had their origins in the adventurer's childhood curiosity. \"He was fascinated by film from the time he was a little child -- he actually pinched chemicals from his grandfather's pharmacy and taught himself how to develop films and he made movies of himself and his friends,\" Schiefelbein said. Cousteau's original ambitions were to forge a naval and aviation career, attending the naval academy in Brest. But a serious car accident in which he broke both his arms ended any dreams of becoming a pilot. \"He was strengthening himself by swimming and he became a naval explorer kind of by default,\" Schiefelbein says. If he came to diving by accident, it was a fortunate accident indeed. It led Cousteau to a lifelong search to find out what lies beneath the surface of the world's oceans. Cousteau's endless curiosity led him to explore ever more remote, ever deeper waters. But he needed something to help withstand high water pressures and capable of maneuvering silently like a diver without disturbing the aquatic life around it. Submarines couldn't work because of the turbulence and danger of their propellers. Nothing like he had in mind existed, so Cousteau invented it. \"He had the idea for it at lunch. He pulled out a saucer from under a coffee cup and then put another one on top and he said 'something like this,' and in two weeks he had scientists working on the idea,\" Schiefelbein said. With the help of Jean Mollard from the French Center for Undersea Research, Cousteau created the \"diving saucer,\" or the SP-350 as it was formally known -- a two-man submarine which could dive to depths of 350 meters for several hours at a time. He very often insisted on testing his new devices and techniques himself, frequently risking his own life in the process. \"Here was a man who took these devices down enormous depths, not having any idea of what would happen and he had to find out for himself. So it was really trial and error in a very dangerous sense. And he always survived,\" Schiefelbein said. But the French explorer's vision was not limited to the world of diving. He saw the need to take on broader issues especially those concerning the environment and the seas. In the 1960s, he campaigned to stop underwater dumping of nuclear waste in the Mediterranean Sea and helped restrict commercial whaling in the 1980s, doing his bit to protect the world he so enjoyed exploring. \"If somebody said: 'what do you expect to see at the bottom of the Romanche Trench?' -- which they were the first to photograph -- he would say: 'If I knew what I expected to see why would I go? Why would I even look?' So it was 'allez voir,'\" Schiefelbein says. \"Allez voir\" (\"go see\") was advice that Cousteau himself followed right until the end."}

A council clerk who stole £162,000 from taxpayers to fund her 'shopping addiction' was today ordered to pay back less than half. Patricia Bell, 58, was jailed for 28 months last year after a judge heard she used a special pen to forge cheques while working at Whitehill Town Council in Hampshire. She tricked councillors she worked for into thinking they were signing legitimate cheques after she had written the correct name using a fabric pen. Patricia Bell will have to pay back £70,684 of the £162,000 she stole - just 44 per cent . But Bell - who earned £46,000 a year - would then remove the name by heating the ink and replace it with her details. She used the stolen funds to pay for expensive handbags and holidays, Winchester Crown Court heard. But today a judge ordered her to pay back just £70,684 at a confiscation hearing - 44 per cent of that stolen. The married mum-of-two paid £110,000 of altered cheques into her account and transferred another £45,000 of additional cheques including extra salary payments. Bell also claimed £7,000 worth of expenses including food shopping bills, receipts, and eBay purchases - taking the total to £162,000. She used the money, which she stole over five years, to fuel her 'shopping addiction' which enabled her to pay for holidays, handbags and nail manicures. Sentencing judge Linda Sullivan said: 'I . have no doubt that you maximised the ease of how you were able to take . this money and you did so in a sophisticated fashion.' If she fails to settle the bill in six months she will be jailed for a further year. Once councillors identified financial irregularities an internal investigation was launched and Bell was forced to attend a meeting with senior councillors. She admitted the allegations were true and was suspended for potential gross misconduct. The council then commissioned an independent investigator to ascertain the facts of the financial irregularities. On February 18, 2013, the council dismissed Bell on the grounds she abused procedures to pay herself by falsifying reports, accounts and expense claims. She used the stolen funds to pay for expensive handbags and holidays, Winchester Crown Court heard . Bell was then arrested and later charged with fraud by abuse of position. Anthony Rimmer, defending, claimed his client had worked hard in the public sector up until the incidents that took place from 2007. He said: 'Mrs Bell had spent 37 years working in the public sector, working for Action for Children and other district councils. 'It was only until she turned 53 that she started doing this. She would often throw away the fabric pens in a bid to stop what she was doing, but ended up buying more.' The former chairman and treasurer of the Hampshire Society of Local Councils pleaded guilty to one count of fraud by abuse of position. She sat in the dock with her head down for most of the sentencing, holding a box of tissues throughout. Bell was wearing a black and grey striped dress and tears streamed down her face when her sentence was read out. New council clerk Chris Young, 61, worked under Bell and replaced her after she was suspended. He said: 'She was well presented and always looked very glamorous. 'She would often come into work with a new handbag and her nails and hair were always immaculate.'"}

With the nation facing the prospect of a triple-dip recession and years of austerity, Sir Jeremy, the £190,000-a-year Cabinet Secretary and one of David Cameron’s most trusted advisers, is believed to have spent about £200,000 to build several basement rooms, including the wine cellar. Britain’s most senior civil servant astonished MPs when he admitted last week that he failed to check if former Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell had used the word ‘pleb’ when he swore at  a policeman at the gates of Downing Street last year. Sir Jeremy, 51, said he suspected a ‘gigantic conspiracy’ but admitted that he did not  look into the most contentious allegation made about Mr Mitchell, who was forced to  quit over the row, because he  was too busy. Married father-of-three Sir Jeremy is said to have accepted a five-figure bonus  last year despite Cabinet Ministers urging restraint.

About 300 children are believed to attend the school. Staff called the Sheriff's office reporting that students and staff were dizzy and sick. San Juan School District Superintendent Douglas Wright said the leak occurred as people arrived at the school and before the day’s classes started. The exhaust of a faulty water heater system is suspected to have caused the leak, according to Clayton Holt, the business administrator for the San Juan School District. A carbon monoxide leak Monday at Montezuma Creek Elementary in southeastern Utah elementary sickened over 50 people, with more than half that number hospital and two considered critical. County Emergency Services Director Rick Bailey said paramedics were rushed to the school from Bluff, Monticello and Blanding, along with three Navajo National ambulances and police officers from several jurisdictions. 'A total of 30 students and adults were triaged at the scene,' Bailey said. 'Two patients, including one student and one [female] adult were transported via medical helicopter to area hospitals.' He said 23 other students and adults went to local hospitals by ground transport. The remained of the students were transferred to White Horse High School. Holt said that as of early afternoon, doctors at Blue Mountain Hospital in Blanding, and at other area medical facilities, reported that all their patients were in good condition. He said he understood the one adult female and one child airlifted from the school to more distant medical facilities remained in 'serious shape,' but he had no further information. Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless and tasteless gas that is slightly less dense than air. It is toxic to humans and animals when encountered in higher concentrations, however it is also produced in normal animal metabolism in low quantities.In the atmosphere, it is spatially variable, short lived, having a role in the formation of ground-level ozone. A major industrial source of CO is producer gas, which is used to create heat and fuel equipment like ovens. The school remained closed for the day as authorities further investigated the leak. The school is on the Navajo Reservation about 15 miles west of the Colorado border. Shawna Hamm, who lives in Aneth, a town about 8 miles southeast of Montezuma Creek, said she saw a helicopter fly past her house, as well as two Navajo Nation police officers with lights and sirens. Earlier, she had received a text message from her sister-in-law, a cook at the elementary school, saying that there had been a gas leak and she was feeling dizzy. Hamm’s nephew, a student at the school, also complained of dizziness. While other children were being air- lifted to the hospital, her nephew’s father picked him up and brought him home, where he seemed to be doing fine, Hamm said. She said her sister-in-law, who is about three months pregnant, got a ride to a hospital in Blanding to get checked out. Montezuma Creek is located about 10 miles east of Bluff."}

Natasha Smith feared for her life as she was stripped and violently attacked by a mob of ‘animals’ who ‘tossed me around like fresh meat’ in Cairo’s Tahrir Square. She managed to escape only after putting on a burka and pretending to be the wife of a local man who smuggled her to safety. Miss Smith, 21, eventually ended up in the British Embassy and has now returned to her family home in Weymouth, Dorset. The attack happened on Sunday as crowds celebrated the announcement that Mohammed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood had won the vote to become Egypt’s first elected president. Scroll down to watch interview . Assaulted: Natasha Smith has written about her horrific ordeal in Tahrir Square on her blog . It capped a tense few weeks when there had been fears of a military coup. Miss Smith, who is studying for an MA in international journalism at . Falmouth College, Cornwall, was making a documentary on women’s rights. Her CV says she was working for a ‘multimedia publication’ Fair . Observer, which specialises in international relations. She is due to begin work next month as a researcher for Channel 4’s documentary series Unreported World. Hers is . not the first case of an attack on Western female journalists covering . the uprising in Egypt. In February 2011 CBS chief foreign correspondent . Lara Logan was set upon by 200 men in Tahrir Square while covering the . resignation of former president Hosni Mubarak. US-Egyptian . journalist Mona Eltahawy suffered a brutal sexual and physical assault . inside Cairo’s interior ministry last November, the same month a French . journalist said she had been beaten and sexually assaulted while . covering the protests. Here, in extracts from her blog, Natasha Smith  describes in terrifying detail what happened. By natasha smith . The atmosphere was one of jubilation, . excitement, and happiness as I walked, accompanied by two male . companions for safety, along Kasr El Nil bridge. Women, children and fathers smiled, waved, and cheered happily at my video camera. Fireworks lit up the sky. As . I reached the end of the bridge, I noticed the crowd became thicker, . and decided immediately to turn around to avoid Tahrir Square. My . friends and I tried to leave. I tried to put my camera back in my . rucksack. But in a split second, everything . changed. Suddenly, something shifted. I found myself being dragged from . my male friends, groped all over, with increasing force and aggression. I . screamed. I could see what was happening and I saw that I was powerless . to stop it. Rammed: Crowds in Cairo's Tahrir Square, a focus point for the Arab Spring, where the attack happened . My friend Callum did everything  he . could to hold on to me. But it was no use. Hundreds of men were dragging . me away, kicking and screaming.My camera was snatched from my grasp. My rucksack was torn from my back – it was so crowded that I didn’t even feel it. Men began to rip off my clothes. I . was stripped naked. Their insatiable appetite to hurt me heightened. These men, hundreds of them, had turned from humans to animals. Hundreds of men pulled my limbs apart . and threw me around. They were scratching and clenching my breasts and . forcing their fingers inside me in every possible way. So many men. All I could see was . leering faces, more and more faces sneering and jeering as I was tossed . around like fresh meat among starving lions. Natasha managed to escape after putting on a burka and pretending to be the wife of a local man . A small minority of men, just a . couple at first, tried to protect me and guide me to a tent. The tent . was crushed, its contents scattered all over the ground. I was tossed . around once more, being violated every second. I was dragged naked across the dirty ground. Men pulled my  blonde hair – a beacon of my alien identity. The men trying to protect me tried to . guide me into another tent. I was able to scramble on to the ground. I . sat with my back against a chair and surveyed the surging mob. Although a few men tried to form a . human shield around me, offering me rags to cover my bruised body, men . were still able to touch me. There were just too many. I gazed around at the bared teeth and . raging eyes. I was struggling to breathe. One man lifted a tent pole . and attempted to strike me with it. At this point, I said aloud to . myself, calmly, over and over: ‘Please God. Please make it stop. Please . God. Please make it stop.’ I’m not religious. But at times of . desperation, we all feel compelled to appeal to some higher power to . save us. It’s human nature. I began to think: ‘Maybe this is just . it. Maybe this is how I go, how I die. I hope it’s quick. I hope I die . before they rape me.’ I looked up and saw a couple of women in burkas scattered around. They looked at me blankly, then looked away. After five to ten minutes, my friend . managed to convince people inside a medical tent to form a pathway . through the crowd to guide me into the tent. During transit I was mauled . and invaded. I reached the tent and saw my friend . Callum. Muslim women surrounded me and frantically tried to cover my . naked body. I fell to the ground and apparently temporarily lost . consciousness. Mixed: Tahrir Square was a scene of celebration, but also of a horror, as Natasha Smith was assaulted . Brutal: Smith was attacked as thousands celebrated the victory of the Muslim Brotherhood's candidate as the new president . The women told me the attack was . motivated by rumours spread by trouble-making thugs that I was a foreign . spy, following a national advertising campaign warning of the dangers . of foreigners. But if that was the cause, it was only really used as a pretext, an excuse, to molest and violate a blonde, young Western girl. The men outside remained thirsty for . blood; their prey had been cruelly snatched from their grasp. They . peered in, so I had to duck down and hide. They attempted to attack the . tent, and those inside began making a barricade out of chairs. Women were crying and telling me: ‘This is not Egypt! This is not Islam! Please, please do not think this is what Egypt is!’ Accidental leader: Mohammed Morsi waves to the crowd during a presidential campaign rally . I reassured them that I knew that was . the case. This vicious act was not representative of the place I had . come to know and love. After much heated debate, it was . decided that Callum and I would leave separately to avoid attracting . attention. I was disguised in a burka and men’s clothes and ordered to . hold the hand of an Egyptian stranger who would pretend to be my . husband. Attacked: CBS reporter Lara Logan moments before she was assaulted in February 2011 . I was terrified but I could see it . was the only way out. He pulled me through the crowds out of the back of . the tent. He told me: ‘Don’t cry. Do not cry. Look normal.’ I was barefoot, dodging broken glass . and debris, trawling through mud and dirt. My inner reserves of strength . kicked in, and I stopped crying and just thought: ‘Keep calm and carry . on.’ The man sat me down by the side of . the road, still ordering me not to cry. Eventually, his friends turned . up, with Callum. They explained that they couldn’t take us to hospital . since they might be arrested if they were seen with us. Callum and I went on our way. We . eventually hailed a taxi. Upon reaching a government hospital down town, . we tried to explain the situation. I was eventually ushered into a small . cubicle. Two men asked: ‘Are you pregnant? Married? A virgin?’ They . seemed displeased by my response of ‘no’. I was refused examination and treatment. Eventually I decided I’d just have to check for damage myself. I went to the bathroom and couldn’t . believe the reflection. I was dirty, wounded, with hair like a tramp and . eyes wide with shock. Finally, I was taken home by my . friends, and put to bed. I didn’t want to tell my family right away, as I . knew it would destroy them. Yesterday [Monday], I had a proper . examination and darted around sorting things out, spending an eternity . giving a police report. During the examination, which was . carried out by a woman, I was crying and shaking. To have someone touch . me so soon after the event was terrifying. Broken and battered: Mona Tahawy was brutally assaulted last year . Later, I couldn’t bear to be around . groups of Egyptian men. And when it got dark, I panicked, and couldn’t . bear to look any man in the eye. I clung to Callum all day. As we drove around Cairo, I couldn’t . help but think: ‘Of all the people we’ve driven past today, one of them . must have been in that crowd of hundreds last night.’ I am determined to continue with my . documentary at some point. [It] will be fuelled by my passion to help . make people aware of just how serious this issue is, and that it’s not . just a passing news story that briefly gets people’s attention then is . forgotten. This is a consistent trend and it has to stop. Arab women, Western women – there are so many sufferers. One of the worst things two nights . ago was that I had never felt so powerless. I had no control and I was . violated. But now I can take control and rebuild my confidence."}
{"prompt": "By . Sophie Borland . Last updated at 8:54 AM on 15th February 2012 . A third of family doctors say their patients are being put at risk in NHS hospitals because of ‘dangerously’ poor care, a survey has revealed. They liken wards to ‘factory production lines’ and admit they would not refer their own family. One said he would not even like his dog to be treated at one hospital. Care fears: Nearly a third of doctors say their patients are being put at risk in NHS hospitals because of poor standards (picture posed by models) One in ten thinks that in the past 12 months at least one of their patients died unnecessarily because the hospital either misdiagnosed them or they were not given the correct treatment. The poll exposes a widespread lack of faith in NHS hospitals. More than one in five (21 per cent) believe the care at their nearest hospital is so dire they would not want to be treated there themselves – and they would not send in their relatives. One family doctor in the North East said that when his wife recently went to hospital there was ‘no appreciation of the human side to her care’. ‘She was in a tunnel where she went in one side and came out the other as if on a factory production line,’ he said. Another unnamed GP in South London said that in the local hospital he was aware of ‘patients not being fed, not being washed, the sort of care that none of us would want ourselves or for our patients’. One from Romford, Essex, said he had written to the chief executive of Barking, Havering and Redbridge Hospitals telling her care was so bad that if he had his way he ‘would not refer a single patient’. Some 34 per cent of doctors said that in the past 12 months at least one of their patients had been subject to hospital care that was ‘dangerously sub-standard’. And nearly three quarters, 74 per cent, said patients had complained to them about the poor treatment on wards. 'Poor care': A GP said he would not send his dog to the Princess Royal University Hospital in Farnborough, Kent . A fifth said they had taken patients to one side before they were admitted to warn them about care. And a third (32 per cent) said they had written to NHS managers to voice their concerns. Another 18 per cent said the hospital care that either they or a family member had received was below standard. Five hundred GPs were questioned for the survey by family doctor magazine Pulse. Last year a series of damning reports by the Care Quality Commission, the Health Service Ombudsman and the Patients Association unearthed harrowing cases of neglect in many hospitals. But this poll reveals for the first time the extent of unease among the NHS’s own doctors. One Oxford GP said that when he asked John Radcliffe Hospital to investigate why his patient had died because staff had misdiagnosed her ovarian cancer, the trust replied saying it had done nothing wrong. Another, in Norfolk, said that his patients are ‘frequently’ being sent home from hospitals too early and many end up going back ‘within a few hours’. Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said: ‘That so many GPs do not have faith in their local hospital is deeply concerning. These results should not be swept under the carpet.’ Dr Richard Vautrey, of the British Medical Association’s GPs committee, said doctors should raise issues directly with the hospital concerned, adding: ‘If we want the best care we must not stay silent when issues arise.’ A spokesman for the Department of Health said the poll only represented a ‘small proportion’ of the 40,000 GPs in the country. He added: ‘That said, we are never complacent about patient safety, and have made it very clear that unsafe care will not be tolerated. This is exactly why we want GPs to take charge of services, in order to arrange the care they think is best for their patients.’"}

{"prompt": "Warning: The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has confirmed a acrylamide, which is found in coffee, is a cancer risk . A chemical found in coffee, chips, burned toast, crisps, crackers and certain types of baby food has been confirmed as a cancer risk by European food watchdogs. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) said children are most exposed to the chemical, which is called acrylamide and forms when roasting, frying and  browning food. Health authorities in Britain and Europe have long been aware of the concerns about the chemical and EFSA was asked to establish the scale of the problem and the risk. It has now published a consultation paper, which warns: ‘EFSA has confirmed previous evaluations that, based on animal studies, acrylamide in food potentially increases the risk of developing cancer for consumers in all age groups. ‘Coffee, fried potato products, biscuits, crackers and crisp breads, soft bread and certain baby foods are important dietary sources of acrylamide. On a body weight basis, children are the most exposed age groups.’ The organisation suggests it may be necessary to establish new legal controls for the food industry to try and reduce the levels found in products sold in restaurants and supermarkets. The watchdog said it may also be necessary to issue new advice to home cooks to help them cut levels of the chemical in home cooked meals. Food manufacturers in Britain have been under pressure to change their cooking methods and recipes in order to reduce the levels of acrylamide formed during cooking. Despite this, the chemical remains at high levels in some products, while acrylamide is also created in the home during roasting and frying. A study published by Britain’s Food Standards Agency (FSA) last year found raised levels of the cancer risk chemical have been found in big brand foods from fries sold by KFC to crisps, ginger biscuits and even healthy breakfast cereals. The chair of an EFSA panel set up to examine acrylamide, Dr Diane Benford, said: ‘Acrylamide consumed orally is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, distributed to all organs and extensively metabolised. ‘Glycidamide, one of the main metabolites from this process, is the most likely cause of the gene mutations and tumours seen in animal studies.’ However, Dr Benford, who is head of chemical risk at the FSA, pointed out that the evidence of harm to humans has, so far, only ‘provided limited and inconsistent evidence of increased risk of developing cancer’. The panel has recommended the need for new research involving humans. It also wants surveys to give a better picture of acrylamide levels in food cooked and eaten in the home. Dangers: The watchdog confirmed children were most exposed to the chemical, which is also found in chips . EFSA said: ‘Once finalised, EFSA’s scientific advice will support European and national decision-makers to consider possible measures to further reduce consumer exposure to this substance in food. ‘These may include, for example, advice on eating habits and home-cooking, or controls on commercial food production.’ In the past, there have been higher levels of the chemical in certain children’ s biscuits, but not in the rusks given to the very young. The UK’s FSA has been carrying out regular surveys of high street food to measure acrylamide levels.  The last survey, published in April 2013, found raised levels in 14 products. The biggest problem was with crisps, including a number of expensive brands such as Burts Sea Salted crisps. The UK's FSA has highlighted high levels of acrylamide in Burts Sea Salted Crisps . There were also raised levels in Tesco ready salted crisps, Tayto cheese and onion crisps, Seabrook Sea Salted crisps, Pipers Anglesey sea salt crisps and the Co-op’s Sea Salt and chardonnay wine vinegar crisps. Manufacturers suggested the problem was caused by the bad weather during the growing season of 2012 which changed the sugar levels in the potatoes thus creating more acrylamide during frying. In terms of take-out food, raised levels were found in a sample of KFC fries bought at a fast food restaurant in Congleton, Cheshire, and a fish and chip shop in the same town. Breakfast cereals are promoted as a healthy start to the day. However, those containing bran, which is cooked at a particularly high temperature, can contain more acrylamide. Raised levels were found in Tesco Bran flakes, Sainsbury’s Wholegrain bran flakes, the Co-op’s Wheat bran flakes and Puffed wheat sold under the Good Grain Co. name. Higher than expected levels were also found in Fox’s Ginger biscuits and TUC biscuits. The FSA stresses that it does not consider the levels of the chemical found in the products to be dangerous, however it is keen that they are brought down as a precautionary measure. A spokesman said: ‘The FSA will work with the relevant local authority to encourage food manufacturers to review their acrylamide reduction strategies.’ The watchdog says there is no need for the public to give up the foods named in its survey, however it does publish advice on how people can reduce exposure. This includes cooking chips only to a light golden colour while advising that ‘bread should be toasted to the lightest colour acceptable’.  It said manufacturers’ instructions for frying or oven-heating foods, such as chips, should be followed carefully."}

{"prompt": "Chinese doctors claim to have diagnosed a new mental illness - porn traumatic stress disorder. The condition was defined after examining the case of a teenager who says his life was ruined by being exposed to pornography from the age of five. Lei Chung, 16, used to live with his mother and father in a tiny one bedroom flat in the city of Dongguan in southern China's Guangdong Province. Lei Chung, 16, has been diagnosed with what doctors say is a new mental illness - porn traumatic stress disorder. The condition was defined after the teenager said his life had been ruined by being exposed to pornography from the age of five . He claims that at the age of five, he would lie awake at night and stare at his father using the computer on the table next to his bed to watch porn movies. He told doctors: 'I tried not to look, but there were always these noises - and when I did look I couldn't get the images out of my head.' He claims that when he asked his father not to watch such material, he had beaten him, and the situation at home had become even worse. The images have haunted him ever since. It is reported that despite starting out well at school, he was unable to get the graphic images out of his head. As a result, his school work suffered, leading to him eventually dropping out. He was also unable to get a job because the porn images had constantly been floating around in his mind. His despair at the graphic images inside his mind led to him quitting school and trying to commit suicide . In the end he tried to commit suicide, but was persuaded out of it by a friend who urged him to seek medical advice. Doctors have now confirmed the pornographic films that have haunted the boy through his life are to blame for his suffering. However instead of post-traumatic stress disorder, they have branded it porn traumatic stress disorder. Doctor Yi Tu, who has been treating Lei, said: 'It is a clear case proving that the exposure of young children to pornographic material before they really have the capacity to understand it is seriously damaging to their mental health. 'Parents should take steps to make sure children are not exposed to this sort of imagery and especially not at such a young age.'"}

{"prompt": "(CNN) -- The head of a survivors' group Saturday dismissed an apology issued five decades later by the German manufacturer of a drug that caused thousands of babies to be born with disabilities. Pharmaceutical firm Gruenenthal apologized Friday for the first time over its drug, thalidomide, which caused babies to be born with shorter arms and legs after their mothers took it during pregnancy in the 1950s and 1960s. It was sold to women to counter morning sickness, according to the Thalidomide Trust, a UK body set up in the 1970s to help those affected. While some children whose mothers took the drug were born with one or more affected limbs, others suffered heart problems, damaged hearing or eyesight, and in some cases, brain damage. The drug was pulled from sale in late 1961 after doctors linked it to birth defects. Freddie Astbury, the president of campaign group Thalidomide UK, who was born in 1959 without arms or legs, said it was too little, too late. \"It's taken a long time for them to apologize. There are a lot of people damaged by thalidomide struggling with health problems in the UK and around the world,\" he said in a statement on the group's website. Britain apologizes to thalidomide victims . \"So we welcome the apology, but how far do they want to go? \"It's no good apologizing if they won't open discussions on compensation. They've got to seriously consider financial compensation for these people.\" Gruenenthal's chief executive, Harald Stock, made the apology Friday as he inaugurated a memorial to those affected in Stolberg, Germany, where the company is based. He expressed the company's \"sincere regrets about the consequences of thalidomide and our deep sympathy for all those affected, their mothers and their families.\" Gruenenthal's nearly 50-year delay in reaching out \"person to person\" to those affected was a result of its \"silent shock\" over their fate, he said. \"Instead, we have been silent and we are very sorry for that,\" Stock said in a translated copy of the speech on the company's website. Many people have only recently started to receive compensation for the drug's effects. More than 10,000 children worldwide are thought to have been affected by thalidomide. Between 5,000 and 6,000 sufferers are still alive, about 400 of them in Britain, according to Thalidomide UK. An additional 7,500 died in early childhood, it says. Stock said the need for Gruenenthal to make a public apology had become apparent in recent talks with those affected, especially since 2007. The company also pledged 50 million euros in 2009 to help more of those people affected in Germany and elsewhere, he said. \"We see both the physical hardship and the emotional stress that the affected, their families and particularly their mothers, had to suffer because of thalidomide and still have to endure day by day,\" he said. \"We wish that the thalidomide tragedy had never happened.\" Personal account: A life shaped by bad medicine . But Stock also pointed to how regulatory and testing organizations had changed since the 1950s. \"The thalidomide tragedy took place 50 years ago in a world completely different from today,\" he said. \"The international scientific community, the pharmaceutical industry and governments, legislators and administrations have had to learn a lot from it.\" Gruenenthal had \"acted in accordance with the state of scientific knowledge and all industry standards for testing new drugs\" that were current in that period, he said, and regretted that the drug's potential to cause fetal malformations had not been detected. The drug was available over the counter in Germany from 1957, under the name Contergan, leading to more cases there than anywhere else, according to the Thalidomide Trust website. In Britain, where it was sold as Distaval, it was a prescription-only medication. The drug was released only for clinical trials in the United States, the Trust says, because of concerns following reports of certain side effects from Europe.

The actor told the New York Times he . is happy for the city to educate people on diabetes, but was not . impressed by their use of an edited image of someone who was not a real . victim of the disease. Mr Berry's IMDB film profile reveals . he was in an episode of the TV series House last year, called Out of the . Chute. He has also been in short films and was a stunt man in ‘The . Strongest Man on Earth’. New York City's health department . confirmed that his leg was removed to make the point of the campaign. The photo came from a company that supplies stock images to advertising . firms. But city officials were slammed for . not revealing that he was not a real amputee victim and did not have . diabetes.

{"prompt": "(CNN)The Manhattan clinic that treated comedian Joan Rivers before her death made a number of serious mistakes, including failing to identify deteriorating vital signs, and providing timely intervention, according to a report released Monday. The report, issued by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), a federal agency, did not mention Rivers by name, but referred an 81-year-old female, or Patient #1. The description of that patient and the procedures she underwent match what's known about Rivers, including her age and the date of her appointment. CMS declined to say whether the patient referenced in the report is Rivers. The famed 81-year-old entertainer died September 4, a week after an appointment at Manhattan's Yorkville Endoscopy clinic. Among the major errors CMS found the clinic committed are: . -- Failing to identify deteriorating vital signs and provide timely intervention; . -- Failing to record Rivers' weight, prior to the administration of medication for sedation; . -- Failing to consistently document the dose of Propofol, a sedative, administered; . -- Failing to get Rivers' informed consent for each procedure performed; . -- Failing to ensure that she was cared for only by physicians granted privilege in accordance with the clinic's bylaws; . -- And finally, failing to abide by its own cell phone policy (the report found that a photograph was taken of a surgeon and Rivers while she was under sedation). Yorkville Endoscopy released a statement in response to the report, saying it has been cooperative and already taken steps to correct the situation. \"In response to the statement of deficiencies, Yorkville immediately submitted and implemented a plan of correction that addressed all issues raised. The regulatory agencies are currently reviewing the corrective plan of action and have been in regular contact with Yorkville. \"In addition, the physicians involved in the direct care and treatment referenced in the report no longer practice or provide services at Yorkville,\" it said. Rivers' appointment at the clinic was on August 28. Paramedics rushed Rivers from the clinic to New York's Mount Sinai Hospital a mile away, where she was kept on life support until she died a week later. Her daughter, Melissa, \"is terribly disappointed to learn of the multiple failings on the part of medical personnel and the clinic as evidenced by the CMS report,\" according to a statement from her attorneys. \"As any of us would be, Ms. Rivers is outraged by the misconduct and mismanagement now shown to have occurred before, during and after the procedure,\" it read. The New York medical examiner ruled last month that Rivers died of \"therapeutic complications\" during a procedure to evaluate her \"voice changes\" and stomach reflux.

We pretend we have it all. We pretend we can have it all. ‘My husband and I have been married for 34 years. And we have two daughters.

Discount UK's Ezi-Cig vapouriser lasts up to 220 puffs - the equivalent of a 20 pack of cigarettes . The world's first £1 e-cigarette has gone on sale in in the UK today. Anti-smoking campaigners hope the product, which will be sold at Discount UK's nationwide 70 stores,  will cut the cost of giving up smoking for millions of people. At a fifth of the price of the previous lowest cost disposable brand, the Ezi-Cig quitting aid is the cheapest disposable e-cigarette to ever go on sale. Each disposable vapouriser lasts up to 220 puffs - the equivalent of a 20 pack of cigarettes - and, say product developers, has been developed after two years of research. Each 'cigarette' comes in high (12mg) or medium (8mg) nicotine dosage. Because stock is limited, customers will only be able to buy a maximum of 12 e-cigarettes each. The e-cigarette industry is facing tighter regulation after research found that there is little quality control exercised among manufacturers. Around 1.3million Britons use battery-powered e-cigarettes, which turn nicotine into vapour to be inhaled, avoiding the harm caused by tobacco smoke. Last month the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency decided they must be regulated, like drugs, to make them ‘safer and more effective’. Its research had found that nicotine levels delivered often differed from the amount stated on the label and varied from batch to batch. Other studies have suggested that some e-cigarettes contain potentially harmful contaminants, the MHRA said, and there were anecdotal reports of a user suffering facial burns after one exploded. Although using e-cigarettes is safer than smoking tobacco ‘the long-term safety of these components to the consumer remains unknown’, it said. The Ezi-Cig quitting aid (pictured) is the cheapest disposable e-cigarette to go on sale. It is thought around 1.3 million smokers and ex-tobacco users in the UK use an electronic cigarette - and experts say the figure can only increase . Discount UK, the Leeds-based . company behind single price retailer, Poundworld, is expecting huge . interest in the new Ezi-Cig brand. The product will also go on sale in over 40 Poundworld shops in September. In the UK, 25 per cent of all attempts to kick the habit are made using e-cigarettes, making it the most popular quitting aid. The UK's medicines regulatory body MHRA . is forecasting that e-cigarettes could help save 57,000 British lives . over the next decade. Chris Edwards Junior, trading director at Discount UK Home Stores, said: 'Quitting smoking can be a difficult and . often expensive undertaking. Hopefully, this product will make it . easier for millions to make a change and move one step closer to kicking . the habit for good.' The UK's medicines regulatory body MHRA is forecasting that e-cigarettes like Ezi-Cig (pictured) could help save 57,000 British lives over the next decade . E-cigarettes are designed to imitate smoking behaviour without the use of tobacco and contain no tar, no 'second hand' smoke, ash or odour. A rechargeable version of the Ezi-Cig has also gone on sale with ten cartridges, priced at £4.99. The company said that similar sets often set smokers back around £20. Naomi . Bitcliffe, 27, a smoker from Leeds who has tested the Ezi-Cig said: . 'It's a bit heavier to hold than a normal cigarette but it tastes a lot . cleaner. 'I haven't . bothered buying one in the past because they are too expensive but . priced at £1 - I'll definitely use them to try and cut down. 'It's good to have something to hold and mimicking the action puts you off wanting to light up for real.' Amanda . Sandford, research manager for ASH (Action on Smoking and Health), said: . 'If smokers wish to try e-cigarettes as a way of cutting down or . quitting smoking then these products could be attractive since they are . cheap and don't involve a big financial outlay. Ezi-Cig goes on sale at over 70 Discount UK shops today and will arrive at over 40 Poundworld stores in September . 'However, . we would advise people who want to stop smoking to speak to their . doctor or pharmacist and use licensed nicotine replacement products as . these have a proven track record as effective aids to quitting.' An MHRA spokesman said: 'We cannot comment on price...and without seeing the product we could not comment on the quality. 'Our research has shown that existing electronic cigarettes and other nicotine containing products on the market are not good enough to meet this public health priority.' Some 'nicotine containing products' are already licensed, and the government is working towards licensing for all these products. The MHRA spokesman said: 'It's not about banning products that some people find useful. 'It's about making sure that smokers have an effective alternative that they can rely on to meet their needs.'"}

It is expected to signal a massive crisis for Mr Sarkozy and his third wife Carla Bruni, who are already desperately trying to stave off a range of corruption investigations. The Gaddafi footage, shot in March 2011, shows the former Libyan dictator saying: 'Sarkozy is mentally deficient. It's thanks to me that he became president. We gave him the funds that allowed him to win.' Revelations: In the interview the late Colonel Gaddafi claims to have funded an election campaign for former French president Nicolas Sarkozy, who he refers to as 'mentally deficient' The interview is expected to trigger another massive crisis for Sarkozy and his third wife Carla Bruni, who are already trying to stave off a range of corruption investigations . Sarkozy is accused of accepting millions of pounds in illegal payments from Gaddafi before inviting him on a state visit to the Elysee Palace in 2007. The pair acted like firm allies and friends before the Arab Spring uprising of early 2011, when Gaddafi's hold on power loosened. It was then that Sarkozy turned on his former friend - initiating Nato bombing raids on Libya which eventually ended with Gaddafi being killed. There are even well-sourced claims that Sarkozy personally ordered Gaddafi's killing because of fears that their corrupt dealings would be exposed. Sarkozy is consideirng running for president again in 2017 as incumbent Francois Hollande (pictured) is thought to be doing a bad job . Pouria Amirshahi, a leading Socialist politician in France, described the 'shameful' dealings as being 'akin to prostitution', saying ‘the possibility of corruption is very real.’ In the France 3 TV audio recording, to be broadcast today, Gaddafi said his move to finance Sarkozy was part of his political strategy. ‘For us, as Libyans, if the president of France wins elections thanks to our funds, it is a real advantage,’ Gaddafi told journalist Delphine Minoui. Gaddafi said Sarkozy personally asked him for financial support when he was still France's Interior Minister. Gaddafi, who ruled Libya for more than 40 years, was shot and stabbed to death by a baying mob, after the convoy he was travelling in was bombed by the French airforce. Sarkozy lost the 2012 presidential election to Francois Hollande, and the home he shares with Ms Bruni in Paris was raided by anti-corruption police soon afterwards. As president he was immune from prosecution, but he is now facing a range of enquires, most centring on the raising of illegal funds. Despite all this, Sarkozy is convinced he can run for president again in 2017 because of the disastrous job Hollande is doing as he tries to run France."}
{"prompt": "(CNN) -- Being nice to others and cooperating with them aren't uniquely human traits. Frans de Waal, director of Emory University's Living Links Center at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center in Lawrenceville, Georgia, studies how our close primate relatives also demonstrate behaviors suggestive of a sense of morality. De Waal recently published a book called \"The Bonobo and the Atheist: In Search of Humanism Among the Primates,\" which synthesizes evidence that there are biological roots in human fairness, and explores what that means for the role of religion in human societies. CNN's Kelly Murray recently spoke with De Waal about the book. More about de Waal's research . CNN's Kelly Murray: Tell us about the title of your book. Frans de Waal: Well, the reason I chose that title is, when I bring up the origins of morality, it revolves around God, or comes from religion, and I want to address the issue that I think morality is actually older than religion. So I'm getting into the religion question, and how important is religion for morality. I think it plays a role, but it's a secondary role. Instead of being the source of morality, religion came later, maybe to fortify morality. CNN: How would you say that ethics or morality is separate from religion? De Waal: Well, I think that morality is older. In the sense that I find it very hard to believe that 100,000 or 200,000 years ago, our ancestors did not believe in right and wrong, and did not punish bad behavior, did not care about fairness. Very long ago our ancestors had moral systems. Our current institutions are only a couple of thousand years old, which is really not old in the eyes of a biologist. So I think religion came after morality. Religion may have become a codification of morality, and it may fortify it, but it's not the origin of it. CNN: Why do people need religion? De Waal: Well, that's a good question. I'm struggling with that. I'm personally a nonbeliever, so I'm struggling with if we really need religion. ... I'm from the Netherlands, where 60% of the people are nonbelievers. So in northern Europe, there are actually experiments going on now with societies that are more secular, to see if we can maintain a moral society that way, and for the moment I would say that experiment is going pretty well. ... Personally I think it is possible to build a society that is moral on a nonreligious basis, but the jury is still out on that. CNN: So do you believe that people are generally good? De Waal: Yeah, my view is that you have two (kinds of) people in the world. You have people who think that we are inherently bad and evil and selfish, but with a lot of hard work we can be good, and you have other people like myself who believe that we are inherently good. There's a lot of evidence on the primates that I can use to support that idea that we are inherently good, but on occasion when we get too competitive or frustrated, we turn bad. CNN: So when the stakes are higher for survival, we're more individualistic than group-oriented? De Waal: Oh no, we very much survive by group life. Humans are not able to survive alone. For example, solitary confinement is one of the worst punishments we can give. We are not really made to live alone, we would not survive, and so when things get tough we would actually come together more and be more social when things get tough. CNN: Can you talk about how being nice to another individual helps you? De Waal: Sometimes people put that in a very narrow sense, and they say that everything that humans do or that animals do needs to have a payoff, but that's not true. The example ... of adoption of children, I basically think it's a costly act with no payoff, and these things happen in animals also. Animals sometimes help each other even between species. Dolphins may help human swimmers, and I don't think the dolphins get much out of it. So individual acts don't necessarily need to have a payoff. So they are not selfishly motivated. They are really altruistic, but you have the tendency to help, and to have empathy for others in general, on the average, is beneficial. Because you live in a group, you depend on these others, so you need to care about these others also because your survival depends on group life, and so there is some sort of general payoff, but people often think in terms of each individual act needs to (reap) some benefit but that's not necessarily true. CNN: Tell us more about the origins of empathy. De Waal: We think that the origin of empathy, in the mammals at least, has to do with maternal care. So a female, whether you're a mouse or an elephant, you need to pay attention to your offspring, you need to react to their emotions when they're cold, or in danger, or hungry, and that's where we think the sensitivity to others' emotions come from. That also explains why empathy is more developed in females than males, which is true in many animals, and it's true for humans, and it explains the role of oxytocin. Oxytocin is a maternal hormone. If you spray oxytocin into the nostrils of men and women, you get more empathic (empathetic) reactions from them, and so the general thinking about empathy is that it started in the mammals with maternal care, and then from there it spread to other relationships. So men can definitely have empathy, but they on average have a little bit less of it than women. CNN: By empathy, you mean that they feel each others' pain? De Waal: Well, feeling someone else's joy is also empathy. Being affected by the laugh, as humans are, is a form of empathy. So empathy basically says that you're sensitive to the emotions of others and react to the emotions of others. Sympathy is a bit more complicated. Sympathy is that you want to take action. You want to help somebody else who's in trouble. So sympathy is a bit more specific, it's a bit more action-oriented. Empathy is just a sensitivity. Empathy is not necessarily positive. If someone wants to sell you a bad car for a high price, he also needs to empathize with you in order to get you to buy it. So empathy can be used for good purposes; I think most of the time it is, but it is not always used for good purposes. CNN: In your book, you talk about a female primate who is crouching down giving birth while the rest of the group gathers around, and one of the other females is crouching and acting like the one giving birth. Would that be an example of empathy? De Waal: Yeah, that's an act of mimicry and synchronization, which is the first form of empathy. If you talk with a sad person, you're going to have a sad expression on your face. You're going to feel sad very soon. That is the body channel of empathy. You synchronize with the other, and that female in the birthing scenario was synchronizing with the other. It's a very early form of empathy; we call it \"modes of mimicry,\" when you do the same thing as somebody else. The body channel of empathy is very important to us and we rely on it every day. If you talk with people and you adopt their facial expressions, they will be laughing, you will be laughing, and so on. CNN: Different cultures of humans have different ideas about morality. Is it the same way in primates? Do different groups of primates have different cultures and ways of interacting with each other? De Waal: We do think that primates have different cultures. One group behaves quite differently from another one. I'm not sure that I would say they have different moralities, but they may have different styles of interacting. But (with) the human variation in morality, one society may have different moral rules than another one. In our current society in the U.S. we have debates about gay marriage, abortion - we have a lot of moral debates going on, and years from now we will believe different things from what we believe now, and so morality changes as a result of society, and that means you should not look for specifics of your morality in biology. Biology provides some of the general primate psychology that we have, like pro-social tendencies, sense of fairness, following rules. Our primate background provides that kind of thing, but the specific rules that our society adopts are not contained in biology, and sometimes people confuse that when I say that morality is contained in our biology, that every rule we follow has to come out of biology. I don't think it works that way. I think that we have general tendencies that come from our primate ancestors, and we turn that into our moral system that is suitable to our way of living. CNN: Is there anything we can learn from animals about how to live a good life? De Waal: I don't think I can give you specific lessons for your life out of my animal studies, but I do think the animal studies have some sort of general message that is important. Instead of looking at human morality as something we design in our heads â€” the philosophers want us to believe that by logic and reasoning we arrive at moral principles â€” I think it works very differently. We have a lot of feelings and tendencies that drive us to moral solutions, and yes, we often then later try to justify these solutions and come up with reasons for them, but that's often secondarily. In primate behavior we can see they have a sense of fairness. They have empathy: they enforce rules among themselves, they can delay gratification and they can control their impulses. So many of these tendencies that go into our moralities can be found in other animals, but instead of them coming from logic and reasoning, they actually come from our primate psychology most of the time."}

{"prompt": "(TIME.com) -- It's one thing to find a strategy that works in the lab, but quite another to prove that it's effective in the real world as well. A decade ago, researchers at the National Institutes of Health made headlines when they published the results of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). The study, which was designed to compare the effects of diet and exercise against the best medications to control the chronic disease, surprisingly showed that diet and exercise were better than the best drugs scientists had developed to protect those at highest risk from developing diabetes. The results were encouraging and disheartening at the time, however, since lifestyle changes are notoriously the most difficult to implement. It's too challenging for patients to stick with a diet and exercise program, and even if they did, their motivation typically wanes after six months. TIME.com: Type 2 diabetes is tougher to treat in kids and teens . But the findings -- the diet and exercise group lowered their risk of getting diabetes by 58% compared to those on medications -- were too stunning to ignore. The DPP relied on intensive and highly individualized coaching to help the patients stay on their diet and fitness regimens. How could the strategies used in the DPP be modified to work in the real world, where personal nutritionists and trainers aren't always at our beck and call? Dr. Jun Ma, an associate investigator at the Palo Alto Medical Foundation Research Institute and a consulting professor at Stanford University, was eager to find out. As a primary care physician, she says, \"we know there are huge numbers of patients out there who need this type of intervention. We just don't have the manpower and resources to deliver interventions such as the one tested in the DPP. That motivated me and my collaborators to find practical ways of delivering the principles of DPP in a more realistic manner.\" TIME Video: Competing in the Olympics with Type 1 diabetes . Ma joined forces with scientists at the University of Pittsburgh who had participated in the government's DPP study and were already tackling that very question. They had developed the Group Lifestyle Balance, a curriculum culled from the DPP that they were testing in both group-based and home-based settings. The 12-week program involved either weekly face-to-face sessions with a registered dietitian and fitness instructor in a class setting in which participants learned and discussed healthy diet and exercise techniques, or a self-motivated program based on DVDs that taught participants similar healthy living techniques. Ma used the same Group Lifestyle Balance curriculum and DVD in her study involving 241 people with pre-diabetes, but modified what the self-motivated group received by adding online and e-mail counseling as well. After three months of intensive training and a year of maintenance sessions, the coach-led group lost an average of 14 pounds, while the DVD group shed 10 pounds; the control group, which received usual care but no specific weight-loss goals, lost only five pounds. More than double the proportion of people using the coach-led sessions (37%) reached the DPP goal of losing 7% of their starting body weight, while 36% of those using DVDs and only 14% of those getting usual care reached that goal. TIME.com: Heart risk for diabetics may be exaggerated . The findings confirm that new strategies for helping at-risk people to control and even reverse impending symptoms may be just as effective, if not more so in some cases, than currently available treatments. \"I would want to encourage national initiatives to consider alternative ways for lowering diabetes risk, such as the ones we tested,\" says Ma. \"Based on the evidence, face-to-face interventions seem to have the strongest effect, but there is data accumulating to support alternative delivery strategies such as through DVDs or online. And considering the number of people at risk of diabetes and heart disease, we need to find meaningful and sustainable ways to reach these people.\" Ma says she and her colleagues intentionally tested strategies such as using e-mail reminders, online counseling and self-initiated DVD sessions because they rely on already-existing resources and would not require extensive investment in infrastructure. While the study only followed the participants for 15 months, Ma says continued research on such alternative strategies may lead to methods that are even longer-lasting and inspire even stronger compliance in the future. \"Longer-term follow-up and longer-term success is something that is attracting a lot of research interest right now,\" she says. And as the results suggest, for good reason. This story was originally published on TIME.com. Diet strategies show promise in lowering risk of diabetes . &copy 2012 TIME, Inc.

{"prompt": "Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard has advised Manchester United counterpart David de Gea to look upon the defensive upheaval at Manchester United as a challenge to improve his leadership skills. De Gea, regarded as one of the best shot-stoppers in the world, has conceded 13 goals in seven games this season and looked a forlorn figure with the personnel in front of him changing regularly due to injury, suspension and differing formations. Howard, 35, spent three seasons at United as a young goalkeeper and believes 23-year-old de Gea needs to learn how to play more of a key role in marshalling his back-four. VIDEO Scroll down to watch De Gea get riled up by Sergio Ramos's 'Penenka' penalties . David de Gea (pictured) should learn a 'good lesson' from the current difficulties at Manchester United . Everton stopper Tim Howard (pictured) thinks De Gea can improve as a goalkeeper as a result of this season . Ahead of Everton's visit to Old Trafford on Sunday, Howard argued: 'It is easier when everything is settled in front of you, but for a goalkeeper it is part of the challenge when it's not. 'De Gea is still a young goalkeeper, even as talented as he is. If he can learn that, how to get your point across to different players and get them to respond to you very quickly, that will be a good lesson. 'You have to use a lot of body language, when the ball is out of play and there is a lull in the crowd, you try to make your point concisely. 'You talk to players in the dressing room before the game. You don't want to cloud their thoughts with too many things but you get a few points across to them. It is all a learning process. 'It feels like it was only in the last five years when I turned 30 that I started to really perfect things so it takes a while. But some guys do it quicker than others.' De Gea (centre) has conceded 13 goals in just seven games this season, including against West Ham United . American stopper Howard insists De Gea should embrace 'the challenge' he currently faces at United . Howard was part of Everton's seen that gained their first victory at Old Trafford in 17 years last season and quipped: 'We cracked it, so we want do it again.' And despite Everton currently lying 15th in the table with only one Premier League victory this season, the American regards Wayne Rooney's suspension for United as a big boost for his team. Howard will come up against world stars like Angel Di Maria, Robin van Persie and Falcao at Old Trafford but still thinks the absence of his former United team-mate Rooney is cause for optimism after the striker was sent off last weekend for kicking Stewart Downing against West Ham. 'It is great for us that Rooney won't be playing. Everyone has an opinion about him but as far as I am concerned, Wayne Rooney is a threat. He is a very dangerous threat. 'The more of those you can eliminate, the better. From his standpoint, it is disappointing he is suspended. But for us, it helps us. It is one less thing to worry about.' Howard, who has been at Everton seven years and equalled the club's European appearance record when he faced Krasnodar in the Europa League on Thursday, is enjoying an extraordinary Indian summer to his career. Howard says it is 'great' Rooney will miss Man United's clash with Everton through suspension . His World Cup performances for the USA led to a phone call of congratulations from American President Barack Obama and a petition for airports to be named after him. There has been a minor backlash this season with Howard scrutinised for every goal conceded, particularly when Everton were surprisingly beaten at home by Crystal Palace. 'If I came back again as a footballer, I'd choose to be a number nine. You can miss five chances, score one goal, and you are a hero,' smiled Howard. 'Goalkeepers get caned all over the gaffe. Part of being a top goalkeeper is handling it. There are two goalkeepers in England at the moment (presumably Joe Hart and Simon Mignolet, though Howard declined to name them) who are getting crucified. It is a witch-hunt.' 'I have been at this a long time. The celebrity thing and all that nonsense happened and I was suddenly being invited to all these events and premieres. If it had happened to me as a young kid, it might have been different but I ended up declining most of them to stay at home with the family. I just doing the regular everyday stuff.'"}
{"prompt": "A collection of manuscripts from caves in Afghanistan has provided the first evidence of Jewish communities living in the devoutly Muslim country 1,000 years ago. The cache of Hebrew documents are thought to have originated from the country's northeast region, a Taliban stronghold. The documents, which include biblical commentaries, personal letters and financial records, were unveiled by Israel's National Library after being purchased from private dealers. Significant: Some of the Hebrew documents purchased by Israel's National Archive, which have been described by researchers as one of the most important ever stashes of Jewish documents ever found . Historic: Haggai Ben-Shammai, academic director of Israel's National Library, displays one of the documents from a collection of discarded religious Jewish writings dated from the 10th century . Researchers have described the collection as one of the greatest Jewish archives ever found. The stash has been dubbed the 'Afghan Genizah'. Genizah is a Hebrew term that loosely translates as 'storage' and refers to a storeroom adjacent to a synagogue or Jewish cemetery where Hebrew-language books and papers are kept. Jewish law forbids any writings containing the formal names of God to be thrown away, so the documents are . either buried or stashed away. The collection of documents has provided scholars with fascinating details into the lives of early Jewish communities in ancient Persia. Conditions in the dry, shady caves have helped to preserve the documents, which were identified using carbon-dating technology and by the use of the unique unique Judeo-Persian language. The documents include writings in Hebrew, Aramaic, . Judea-Arabic and the unique Judeo-Persian language from that era. Discovery: Mr Ben-Shammai said it was too early to compare the cache to the Cairo Genizah, the historical stash found in a Cairo synagogue in the late 1800s . Evidence: The documents include biblical commentaries, personal letters and financial records . Haggai Ben-Shammai, the National Library's academic director, said the documents related to the 'Yiddish of Persian Jews'. He said the manuscripts included mentions of distinctly Jewish . names and evidence of their commercial activities along the 'Silk road' connecting Europe and the East. It remains unclear how the ancient . manuscripts emerged. Ben-Shammai said the library was contacted by . various antiquities dealers who got their hands on them. Bargaining: The library purchased 29 out of hundreds of the documents believed to be located around the world last month, after long negotiations with antiquities dealers . The library purchased 29 out . of hundreds of the documents believed to be located around the world last month, . after long negotiations with antiquities dealers, and they arrived in Israel last week. The library refused to . say how much it paid for the collection, adding that it hoped to . purchase more in the future and did not want to drive up prices. Mr Ben-Shammai said it was too early to compare the cache to the Cairo Genizah - a storage of documents found in a synagogue in the late 1800s including thousands of historically important documents. He said it would take a long time to sift through the . findings from Afghanistan and that the documents were already significant since . no other Hebrew writings had even been found so far from the Holy Land. The Jewish community in the . region at the time lived largely like others in the Muslim world, as a 'tolerated minority' that was treated better than under Christian rule, according to the academic. Afghanistan's Jewish community numbered as many as 40,000 in the late . 19th century, after Persian Jews fled forced conversion. By the mid-20th century, only about 5,000 . remained, and most emigrated after Israel's creation in 1948.

A Republican congressional candidate's innuendo-filled ad has gotten him fired from his job as an adjunct professor at a Christian college. J.D. Winteregg is running to unseat House majority leader John Boehner in the upcoming midterm elections, and he made his minute-long ad a play on the Republican leader's name.

'Other . signs of electile dysfunction may include extreme skin discoloration, . the inability to punch one's self out of a wet paper bag, or maintain a . spine in the face of liberal opposition.' By contrast, Mr Winteregg sells himself as a solution to the problems facing Boehner's constituents.

The christening gown worn by gorgeous Prince George has certainly been given a run for its money. A white cotton and lace heirloom from Cambridgeshire has been preserved almost immaculately for 116 years. And this week four-month-old Theodore Thom became the tenth child to be christened in the hand-made gown, which has been passed through seven generations of his family and survived a flood in 2001. Since it was sewn in 1897 by his great-great-great-great-grandmother, a seamstress who lived to 103, it has had just a few alterations. The sleeves have been repaired and some lace flowers have been replaced - but otherwise it looks the same as in the age of Queen Victoria. Fashion statement: Theodore Thom was the fifth generation of his family to wear a 116-year-old christening gown. Pictured with (from left) grandmother Janet, cousins Ruby and Charlotte, aunt Natalie and father Robin . Heirloom: Theodore wearing the gown on the day of his christening with parents Robin and Hannah.

Hand-me-gown: A family tree showing each member of the Thom family, from Cambridgeshire, which has worn the 116-year-old christening robe . Theodore - whose full name is Theodore Robert Spzalek Thom - wore the gown on Sunday for his christening at St Andrew's Church in Girton, Cambridgeshire. Theo’s grandmother Janet Thom, 63, . who has kept the gown at her home in the village and wore it for her christening in 1950, said: 'The Royals seem to have got married at about the same time as my son and now they've got christened at the same time too - although it seems our gown has outlasted theirs a bit! 'I’m so glad the . whole family have worn it. It’s lovely. It’s a great thing to know the dress has been passed down from person to person. 'Family memories mean a lot and this is one of those things that our family can always remember.' Several photos of family members wearing the gown were destroyed when Mrs Thom's home was flooded in 2001. But miraculously the gown, which was also at their home, survived. 'We had four inches of water coming in and all the photographs were in a plastic box under the stairs,' said Mrs Thom, a retired nursery teacher. 'I was devastated'. Theodore's great-great-great-great-grandmother, known only as Grandma Boon, sewed the gown for the christening of her granddaughter May Spitty in 1897 in Bradwell-on-Sea, Essex. May's brother, West Spitty, also wore it before handing it down to May's son Donald Mercier. Donald ensured his daughter Janet - Theodore's grandmother - was christened in the gown, and handed it down to her when she grew up and moved to Cambridgeshire. Janet Thom pictured at her christening in 1950, when she was the fourth member of her family to wear the gown. She said: 'This is one of those things that our family can always remember' Janet Thom was watched lovingly at her christening in 1950 by her father Donald Mercier, right, who was the third person to wear the gown.

She then brought out the antique garment for the christening of her three children, Natalie, 40, Eloise, 36, and Robin, 30. Finally, Natalie used the precious gown for her children Ruby May Kendrew, seven, and Charlotte Kendrew, five, before sustainable energy firm director Robin, who lives in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, dressed his son Theodore in it this week. Theodore's grandmother added: 'Theo’s christening was a great day and I’m glad there were lots of people there to celebrate. 'I’ll keep patching up the dress for as long as I can.' The ceremonial dress dates back to the Victorian era, in which ornate christening gowns were fashionable and prized by the families which owned them. Janet Thom christened her children in the gown. Pictured: her daughter Natalie Thom's christening in 1974 . Soon afterwards the gown was used for the christening of Natalie's sister Eloise, in 1976 . Since 1841, every Royal baby had been christened in a gown which was designed for Queen Victoria's first child. But Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor was the last Royal baby to wear it in 2004, when a replica of the gown was sewn which has been used for every Royal christening since.

{"prompt": "Ill patients who dial 999 for an ambulance are increasingly being sent police cars or taxis instead. One ambulance service has seen a staggering 350 per cent increase in the use of taxis to pick up patients in three years. It comes as ministers announced how £250million would be used in the most stretched A&Es to prevent a crisis in the NHS this winter. Ambulance trusts are using taxis, police cars and firefighters to take patients to hospital, the Commons heard . Figures obtained under Freedom of Information laws by Labour reveal that in 2012-13 158 taxis attended 999 calls in the South Western Ambulance Service area. In 2009-10 the number was just 35. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham also warned police cars were being used on a daily basis to ferry patients to hospital. In another area an ambulance service is using retained firefighters to attend calls. The warning about the crisis in the NHS comes as new figures showed freezing temperatures last winter led to 31,000 extra deaths, in England and Wales. It marked a 29 per cent increase on the previous year. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt today announced details of how an extra £250 million for struggling A&E units will be spent this winter. It includes almost 2,500 extra beds the equivalent of almost 3,000 extra staff. Labour's Andy Burnham (left) revealed the growing reliance on taxis to take patients to hospital, as Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced how funding would be spent on more nurses and beds this winter . Freezing temperatures last winter led to 31,000 deaths, new figures show. The number of 'excess winter deaths' in England and Wales rose by dramatically by 29 per cent compared with the previous year. Campaigners condemned the figures as a 'national scandal'. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the majority of the excess deaths were among pensioners - with over-75s accounting for 25,600 winter-related deaths in 2012-13. Temperatures plunged across Britain at the start of this year, with March the coldest record since 1962 with an average monthly temperature of just 2.6C (36.7F).The ONS said: 'The number of deaths peaked in the first week of January, which coincided with a peak in rates of influenza-like illness over the Christmas weeks. 'The mean number of daily deaths was higher than average for a prolonged period between February and April 2013.' More women died as a result of the cold (18,000) compared to 13,100 men. But in the Commons he was challenged over . the increasing reliance of over-stretched ambulance services on other . vehicles to take patients to hospital. Mr Burnham claimed that as A&Es fill up, ambulances become ‘trapped’ and unable to handover patients. He urged Mr Hunt to take action now to avoid the ambulance hold-ups ‘engulfing’ other emergency services. Mr Burnham told the Commons: ‘Today I want to put to you new evidence that the A&E crisis is deepening and having a serious knock-on effect on ambulance services. ‘Information from police forces reveals that police cars having to ferry patients to A&E is far more widespread than people realise and in some areas happening on a daily basis. ‘One ambulance service is now using retained firefighters to attend calls but this is how bad things have got - another ambulance service has seen a 350 per cent increase in the number of 999 calls attended by taxis. ‘Do you think it's ever acceptable that when a patient dials 999 a taxi turns up instead?’ But Mr Hunt accused his shadow of . talking up a crisis that is not happening and said the coalition was . hitting its targets, unlike the last Labour administration when Mr . Burnham was health secretary. Mr . Hunt replied: ‘I'm afraid this is utterly irresponsible. We are hitting . our A&E target, we are hitting our ambulance standard. When you . were health secretary you missed the ambulance standard for October, . November, December and January. ‘What . you are doing is trying to talk up a crisis that isn't happening and . you should think about people on the front line and just for once put . patients before politics.’ Mr Burnham suggested that the country would have heard Mr Hunt's ‘complacency’ and warned large parts of the country did not have adequate ambulance cover. He told the Health Secretary: ‘You didn't condemn the use of taxis. I'll tell you now, it's unacceptable but it's happening on your watch and why? ‘Because ambulances are trapped at A&Es, unable to hand over patients. This means 999 response times are getting worse and large swathes of the country right now are without adequate ambulance cover. ‘Isn't it time you were honest with the public, admitted the scale of the crisis facing the NHS this winter and took action now to prevent it engulfing other emergency services?’"}
{"prompt": "Argyll, Scotland (CNN) -- Magnus MacFarlane-Barrow was enjoying a pint at his local pub in the Scottish Highlands when he got an idea that would change his life -- and the lives of thousands of others. It was 1992, and MacFarlane-Barrow and his brother Fergus had just seen a news report about refugee camps in Bosnia. The images of people suffering in the war-torn country shocked the two salmon farmers, who'd visited there as teenagers and remembered the warmth of the Bosnian people. \"We began saying 'Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could just do one small thing to help?' \" MacFarlane-Barrow says. After talking it over, the two men took a week off work and collected food, clothing, medicine and blankets. They loaded everything into an old Land Rover, drove to Bosnia to deliver it and returned to Scotland. \"I came back here thinking that I did my one good deed and it would be back to work, but it [didn't work] out like that, \" he says. When they arrived home, the brothers found an avalanche of goods that people had continued to donate while they were away. \"I was touched by the overwhelming generosity of others,\" MacFarlane-Barrow remembers. \"I saw all of those donations in our family home and thought, 'Wow, people really are good,' and it inspired me to be good too.\" After much thought and prayer, Magnus MacFarlane-Barrow quit his job, sold his home and dedicated himself to helping people in need. He returned to Bosnia with aid 22 more times during the Bosnian War, and over the next 18 years his work expanded and evolved. Today, his program -- Mary's Meals, named after the Virgin Mary -- provides free daily meals to more than 400,000 children around the world. MacFarlane-Barrow found his current focus in 2002 while working in Malawi -- a country ravaged by famine and AIDS -- when he met a local teenager who just wanted a decent meal and an education. \"The mother of the family was dying of AIDS. She was lying on her bare mud floor, and she had her six children around her, \" he says. \"I started talking to her oldest child, Edward. And Edward said, 'I'd like to have enough food to eat. I'd like to go to school one day.' \" In response, he launched Mary's Meals, which strives to break the cycle of poverty by feeding children a daily meal at school. The food -- in most places a mug of maize-based porridge -- gives students an incentive to continue their schooling and helps them focus better on their studies. It's a formula that MacFarlane-Barrow says is working. \"Pass rates go up dramatically in the schools where we start providing Mary's Meals,\" he says. \"We've seen huge improvements in attendance rates and academic performance.\" Mary's Meals partners with local residents, who handle the daily work of cooking and serving the food. In Malawi -- the group's largest effort -- more than 10,000 volunteers donate their time on a regular basis. The program operates in more than 500 schools and child-care facilities in 15 countries, a global effort that MacFarlane-Barrow coordinates from a tin shed on his parents' property in Scotland. While the married father of six lives on the property, he spends most of his time abroad, overseeing the project and visiting the schools where meals are served. \"I see the children's faces as they eat their meal, \" he says. \"Knowing I can transform their lives keeps me motivated.\" But there are always new challenges to overcome, most recently in Haiti, where Mary's Meals has operated since 2006. Working in partnership with a local Catholic priest, the group was feeding about 12,000 children a day when the earthquake hit in January. Much of the infrastructure the program relied on in the slums of Cite Soleil was destroyed, so the group's mission expanded. They helped create temporary classrooms and are rebuilding eight schools in the area. In addition to their school-based feeding program, the group now feeds about 2,000 elderly Haitians and is providing additional food and medicine to the community. MacFarlane-Barrow is driven by his Christian faith, but there is no ministry aspect to his work. \"We are very careful to never link feeding and faith,\" he says. \"We serve those who are in need ... period. \"When I think of Mary's Meals I think of it as a series of lots and lots of little acts of love, \" he says. \"I've learned ... that every small act of kindness does make a difference.\" Want to get involved?

The pretty blonde from the Gold Coast is unusually quiet after undergoing a boob job at Bangkok's Piyavate Hospital to increase her asymmetrical 10A and 10C chest to matching Ds. Propped up against a mountain of pillows, drains attached to her bandaged chest, she calls for the nurse demanding more pain killers before glancing down at her chest and declaring: 'Hello my lovely Bangkok babies!' Dream come true: Big Brother's Skye Wheatley is recovering after undergoing a boob job at Bangkok's Piyavate Hospital to increase her asymmetrical 10A and 10C chest to matching Ds . The reality TV star is among 15,000 Australians who fly to Thailand every year in pursuit of affordable cosmetic surgery. But some Australian medical experts have growing concerns over the commercialisation of cosmetic surgery, especially patients who travel abroad to go under the knife. Ta da! Skye admires the work of her Bangkok doctor post surgery . The 20-year-old barista from Labrador has long wanted to correct and enhance her wonky cleavage, insisting boyfriends called her 'pancake' because of her flat chest. Fed up with feeling deflated, she signed up to a 10-day tour with Australian-wide medical tourism agency, Medi Makeovers, lured by the promise of cut price surgery. Instead of forking out up to $12,000-$15,000 for a breast augmentation Down Under, patients can get breast implants and other procedure  often for a third of the price at $3,800 with highly qualified plastic surgeons. Skye, however, didn't anticipate the pain of undergoing three-hour surgery, which she describes as 'the worst I have ever felt.' Holding her chest tightly, mascara tears rolling down her eyes, she added: 'This has to be worse than childbirth, surely?' 'I've ripped my nail off, I've split my head open but this is something else. 'No one who's had a boob job ever tells you about the pain, they just sit on the beach and say \"I love my boobies.\" 'I've got Tourette's Syndrome, the pain is so bad I can't stop swearing.' The aftermath of surgery: Skye, however, didn't anticipate the pain of undergoing three-hour surgery, which she describes as 'the worst I have ever felt' Fan favourite: Skye rose to fame after appearing on the 2014 season of Big Brother Australia . Beauty is pain: Propped up against a mountain of pillows, drains attached to her bandaged chest, she calls for the nurse demanding more pain killers before glancing down at her chest and declaring: 'Hello my lovely Bangkok babies!' Waiting for the pain to subside: Fed up of feeling deflated over her smaller breasts, she signed up to a 10-day tour with Australian-wide medical tourism agency, Medi Makeovers, lured by the promise of cut price surgery . There are 15,000 Australians who jet to Thailand every year seeking cheaper cosmetic surgery at the hands of highly qualified surgeons for often a third of the price of the equivalent procedure in Australia. Thailand, which once bore company with dodgy back street surgeons and unsafe practises, is today the hub of a booming multi-billion dollar medical tourism industry, which pulled in a staggering $4.31 billion in revenue in 2013. Dr Tim Papadopoulos, the president of the Australasian Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, is concerned about the commercialisation of cosmetic surgery and patients who travel abroad to contribute to this lucrative business. He describes the recent hype over medical tourism - cosmetic surgery in particular - as a 'global health bazaar'. A good deal: Instead of forking out up to $12,000-$15,000 for a breast augmentation Down Under, patients can get breast implants and other procedures, often for a third of the price at $3,800 with highly qualified plastic surgeons . Recovering after surgery: The 20-year-old barista from Labrador has long wanted to correct and enhance her wonky cleavage insisting boyfriends called her 'pancake' because of her flat chest . Reality sets in: Holding her chest tightly, mascara tears rolling down her eyes, she added: 'This has to be worse than childbirth, surely?' In pain: Skye found herself in tears following the surgery . But what's most distressing for Dr Papadopoulos is that medical tourism companies are subject to little oversight and not obliged to undergo accreditation. 'Commercialisation of cosmetic surgery and medical tourism threatens our efforts to convince the public that medicine is not a commodity or a trade,' Dr Papadopoulos told Daily Mail Australia. 'It emphasises positive outcomes and downplays the pain and risks of medical intervention.' And he's seen firsthand the 'good, the bad and the ugly of medical tourism'. 'Most times patients get good results but we do deal with a number of patients who come to us for complications from overseas procedures,' Dr Papadopoulos said. Common complications include: infections, incompletely healed wounds and asymmetrical scars. 'Some of the important risks patients should be aware of is whether they are going to an appropriate institution or facility,' Dr Papadopoulos said. 'They should also know about their doctor, whether they are properly qualified and whether the plastic surgery is board certified.' Post op: Sitting propped up in her hospital bed, the beautiful blonde looked vulnerable . Step-by-step: Daily Mail Australia has followed Skye's plastic surgery journey . On top of the world: The Gold Coast babe talked of her pain following her procedure but is happy with the end result . 'The pain is so bad I can't stop swearing': Overwhelmed by pain following her operation, Skye burst into tears . The cosmetic surgery journey for Skye began when she arrived in Bangkok on Monday night. The following morning she saw reconstructive plastic surgeon doctor Rungkit Tanjapatkul who sized her up suggesting different types of implants to align her breasts - and who advised her to drop her dream of DDs for Ds. That same night she was wheeled into surgery and, recalling the experience the next day, Skye said: 'I was so scared I prayed to God. I told him \"I'm so grateful for everything, except my boobs, God, please look after me on the operating table.\"' The reality star, known for her flirtatious antics on the show with fellow contestants Jake Richardson and Ryan 'Leo' Burke, will be discharged from hospital on Thursday at 2pm once her drains and bandages have been removed. Happy on the inside: Despite the tears, Skye is ecstatic about her new 10D breasts . Sizing her up: Reconstructive plastic surgeon doctor Rungkit Tanjapatkul sizes up the Big Brother star's breasts in Bangkok on Tuesday . Considerations: Skye stands in front of a mirror in a white T-shirt to see what will work . She will spend the next week convalescing at the city's five star Grande Centre Point Ploenchit hotel. Skye's stitches will be removed in seven days and she has been advised to wear compression garments for three months. 'I can't wait to see them,' she says, adding, 'They feel nice already, really plump, whoever said fake boobs don't feel good? I'm so excited.' 'Deformed': The former barista from the Gold Coast insists her size 10 assets are asymmetrical . Medi Makeovers is a mother-and-daughter medical travel agency with consultants in Sydney, the Gold Coast, Adelaide and New Zealand. Set up in 2006 by former beauty therapist and salon owner Daniela Pratico, it sends over an average fifty Australians for plastic surgery to Thailand every month. It is billed as Australia's number one medical travel agency, working with the Royal Thai Consulate-General and Thai Government. Clients hail from the UK, USA, Canada, Singapore, United Arab Emirates, Guam, Russia, Sweden, China and Japan. Since placing third in Big Brother last year, Skye has been besieged with calls from marketing companies and publicity reps, asking her to endorse products on social media, including everything from bikinis to underwear- offers she feels she can't take full advantage of until after surgery. 'I need to look symmetrical now,' she says. 'It's not about size, it's about choice,' she says, adding, 'Why not if you can? I like the perfect look.' She insists she wants to remain single 'for now', having spent many years in relationships. And she plans to take up professional singing lessons and carve out a career in music, while continuing promotional work for brands. Nerves: Sitting in the waiting room, the reality star is overwhelmed with some level of anxiety . Overseas trip: Skye has travelled abroad for the first time with Australia-wide medical travel agency Medi Makeovers to fix what she calls ‘wonky boobs’ that have made her feel deflated for years . 'You know, I just want to be a reality star forever,' she says. 'This is all about me now,' she adds. 'I need to find out what I want in life and to look good for myself and not worry about having a boyfriend or what a boyfriend wants.' Doctor Rungkit told Daily Mail Australia Thailand is the 'hub' of cosmetic surgery with the bulk of clients coming from Australia. 'Plastic surgery is a growing industry in Thailand, people never stop wanting to look young and better. If anything the numbers of people wanting surgery will only increase.' Revamp: The bubbly blonde says she doesn't want to give young fans the impression she is opting for surgery abroad without due consideration of the risks-  but wants to finally feel comfortable in her own skin ."}
{"prompt": "(CNN) -- An international music awards show announced a new Adele album Tuesday -- but nothing's happening, says her label chief. The confusion started with a tweet from the World Music Awards, an international contest that has been broadcast from such locales as Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Monaco. In a tweet, the show said, \"#adele confirms 2015 Tour After The Release Of Her New Album '25'!\" Not so fast, said Martin Mills, who heads Beggars Group. Adele's label, XL Recordings, is a subsidiary of Beggars Group. There's \"no truth in this,\" he told Billboard. So what's the deal with the World Music Awards? It may have gotten attention for the tweet, but Billboard observed that the contest is \"something of a curiosity on the international awards calendar.\" The American broadcast of its 2014 show was supposed to run on NBC but didn't because of \"technical issues.\" Adele herself has said little. She did hint in May that a new work could be in the offing, but her Twitter account has mostly been silent, with just three tweets since that May 4 post. (The most recent promoted an album by Example.) Certainly, even a smidgen of Adele news is eagerly awaited by her fans -- and the music business, which would love to see any material equal the performance of the English singer's last record, \"21.\" That album sold 3 million copies through digital streaming alone, which set a record. Altogether, it's sold more than 10 million copies and topped Billboard's year-end sales list in both 2011 and 2012 -- the first album ever to do that. Oh, and \"21\" won the Grammy for album of the year. Since \"21's\" success, Adele has won an Oscar for best original song (for \"Skyfall,\" from the James Bond movie of the same name) and given birth to a son with her partner, Simon Konecki."}

A man due to stand trial for murder has escaped one of Russia’s most notorious prisons using a spoon and his bed sheets. Oleg Topalov, 32, accused of two counts of murder and illegal possession of firearms, broke out of maximum-security Matrosskaya Tishina jail in the early hours of Tuesday. Topalov, described as ‘mentally abnormal’ by prison staff, used a tablespoon to carve a hole into the ceiling of his cell at the Moscow prison and escaped through the ventilation vent, investigators said today. Daring escape: Oleg Topalov, due to stand trial for two counts of murder, escaped from the maximum security unit using a spoon and some bedsheets . Topalov is the fourth man in 20 years to escape from the infamous prison, and the first to break out of a detention centre in the Russian capital in 12 years. Guards at Matrosskaya Tishina discovered that Topalov was missing from the eight-person cell  around 5am Tuesday morning. 'It was established that Oleg Topalov used a spoon to scrape away the cement and brickwork from the wall of the ventilation shaft in his cell,' an investigator told Interfax. Matrosskaya Tishina opened in 1918 and although it has a reputation as one of the worst prisons in Russia, it is in desperate need of building maintenance, something which authorities say made it easy for Topalov to dig himself out. High security: Topalov is the fourth man in 20 years to escape from the infamous Matrosskaya Tishina prison, located in northern Moscow . ‘Because of the building being run-down, Topalov had no difficulty in widening the vent of the air-shaft, through which he got to the prison’s roof,’ Russian Federal Penitentiary Service representative Kristina Belousova told RIA Novosti. The escapee then jumped from the building’s roof into a neighbouring block before lowering himself to the ground using a rope he made from bed sheets. Moscow police have mobilised an extensive search, offering a ‘large reward’ for information which could lead to the capture of Topalov, from Sochi near the Georgian border. Topalov was due to appear in court accused of two counts of murder and illegal possession of firearms, and had been held on remand at Matrosskaya Tishina for a year-and-a-half before his escape."}
{"prompt": "HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Some of Zimbabwe's children are \"wasting away\" as political turmoil and economic crisis have caused a severe food shortage, according to a report from Save the Children. Children sleep in rough conditions on the border between Zimbabwe and South Africa. The number of acute child malnutrition cases has risen by almost two-thirds in the past year, the report from the UK-based agency said in its appeal to world donors for help. \"There is no excuse for failing to provide this food,\" program director Lynn Walker said. \"The innocent people of Zimbabwe should not be made to suffer for a political situation that is out of their control.\" Five million Zimbabweans -- out of a population of about 12 million -- are in need of food aid now, the report said. The group is appealing for 18,000 tons of food for next month. \"We have already been forced to reduce the rations of emergency food we are delivering because there isn't enough to go around,\" the report said. \"If, as we fear, the food aid pipeline into Zimbabwe begins to fail in the new year the millions of people who rely on emergency food aid will suffer.\" Zimbabwe is facing its worst economic and humanitarian crisis since its independence from Great Britain 28 years ago. There is an acute shortage of all essentials such as cash, fuel, medical drugs, electricity and food. President Robert Mugabe blames the crisis on the sanctions imposed on him and his cronies by the West for allegedly disregarding human rights. But Mugabe's critics attribute the crisis to his economic policies. As the economy has faltered for almost a decade now, a cholera epidemic is raging, fueled by the collapse of health, sanitation and water services in Zimbabwe. The epidemic has claimed more than 1,100 lives and infected more than 20,000 people since its outbreak in August. Health experts have warned that the water-borne disease could infect more than 60,000 unless its spread is halted. The political crisis rose to a boil in this year when the opposition party claimed that it won the presidential election, but Mugabe's government refused to recognize the result. Instead, the race was thrown to a runoff, which was boycotted by the opposition. Mugabe signed an agreement with the opposition in September to form a unity government, but a bitter dispute over the division of cabinet seats has prevented its formation. Inflation is so severe that the government was forced to print $10 billion currency notes last week, with each expected to buy just 20 loaves of bread."}
{"prompt": "(CNN) -- It's becoming a cliché: The tide is turning in the debate over cannabis. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, publicly reversed his position and now supports medical cannabis. Republican Gov. Chris Christie just expanded New Jersey's medicinal marijuana laws.  In the past month, New Hampshire and Illinois have become the 19th and 20th states to approve medical marijuana. But the debate over medical marijuana obscures the more fundamental issue of our failed war on pot and the path to smart legalization. I had an opportunity to explore the full range of perspectives in the marijuana debate at the recent 2013 Annual Meeting of the American Psychiatric Association. What I learned can be simply stated: Nationwide cannabis legalization is coming and smart regulation is the key to its success. At the convention, held in San Francisco, I listened to and spoke with respected leaders of the opposition to cannabis legalization, who are mostly specialized in the treatment of substance use disorders. The Bay Area is a proving ground for California's liberal medical marijuana laws. Amanda Reiman, policy manager for the California branch of the pro-legalization Drug Policy Alliance, took me on a tour of local cannabis dispensaries. And Oaksterdam University invited me to speak at their makeshift headquarters -- their previous location was closed after a DEA raid last year -- where classes are offered on all things cannabis. The dispensaries are largely self-regulated, yet all facilities are immaculate, security is tight, and members of the staff are knowledgeable about the science of cannabis. Surely not all points of access are as well-run as these dispensaries, but they could be. And only with legalization and regulation can we expect that they would be. Most legalization advocates and opponents share concerns about underage pot use, an opposition to incarcerating users, and a recognition that marijuana is less harmful to adults than alcohol. Opinion: Americans agree, pot is no crime . Most agree public opinion has shifted in favor of cannabis legalization, although the two groups have strongly divergent feelings about the change. A minority of advocates call for America to \"free the weed\" with few restrictions, while opponents at the American Psychiatric Association fear that legalization would lead to \"a nation of drunken stoners\" after an anticipated rise in adolescent use of this and other drugs. The substance abuse treatment community has legitimate concerns, and recreational cannabis should not be legalized -- for minors. If national polls are correct, and wisdom prevails, then America is rapidly moving toward legal cannabis for adults. We must stop arguing about the right of consenting adults to consume a relatively safe recreational drug, and discuss how -- rather than whether -- cannabis should be properly regulated by the federal government. First, consider the four essential goals of marijuana regulation: keeping cannabis out of the hands of minors; reducing harm to adult users; preventing collateral harm to the public and getting the maximum economic benefit from legalization. Our approach to federal regulation should synthesize the perspectives of both advocates and opponents of legalization. We should look to research on laws controlling alcohol, tobacco and gambling. We can also learn from Colorado and Washington, which have developed regulations for recreational cannabis, and the 18 other states -- plus the District of Columbia -- that have legalized medical marijuana. We can achieve the essential goals of regulation if we: . • Require proper labeling of cannabis products, including the quantities of key ingredients like THC and CBD. • Test cannabis products for contaminants and label accuracy. • Require government supervision of all facilities involved in the production, distribution and sale of cannabis. • Limit advertising, sales and public consumption of cannabis products the way we do with alcohol and/or tobacco. • Ban cannabis packaging and advertising that targets or attracts underage users. • Require child-resistant packaging for edible cannabis products. • Impose penalties on adults who enable minors to get marijuana. • Allow adults to grow a small number of cannabis plants for personal use. • Prosecute cannabis-impaired driving with field sobriety tests. • Continue restrictions on cannabis use by professionals and laborers when scientific evidence indicates that such use risks public safety. • Empower states and municipalities to restrict the cannabis trade within their borders. • Fund education of adults about the use and abuse of cannabis. • Fund preventive youth education about the dangers of underage cannabis use. • Fund treatment of adults and minors with cannabis use disorders. • Tax all aspects of the cannabis trade at the highest rate that the free market will bear, using a portion of the proceeds to fund regulation, education and treatment. Just as responsible fishermen support the conservation of marine ecosystems, even marijuana enthusiasts can offer smart ideas for the successful legalization of cannabis, the fiercest critics of pot legalization have legitimate concerns, particularly about pot's effects on developing brains of young people. Advocates and opponents need to come together for an open-minded discussion about the regulation of marijuana in the United States. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Nathan."}

{"prompt": "(CNN) -- In addition to his unforgettable work as a comedian and actor, Robin Williams leaves behind close friends and family who loved him -- and also a tribe of fellow artists who hope to follow in his footsteps. As Hollywood and fans mourned the loss of Williams, who committed suicide at his California home Monday, a younger generation of comedic actors expressed their admiration for the legendary performer. And, like the rest of us, they tried to make sense of it. In a poignant essay published in The Guardian, actor and comedian Russell Brand gave this assessment of Williams: \"Hidden behind his beard and kindness and compliments was a kind of awkwardness, like he was in the wrong context or element, a fallen bird on a hard floor.\" Yet there was so much talent. \"Robin Williams was exciting to me because he seemed to be sat upon a geyser of comedy,\" Brand wrote. \"Like he didn't manufacture it laboriously within but had only to open a valve and it would come bursting through in effervescent jets. He was plugged into the mains of comedy.\" In some ways, Brand is the ideal person to write about Williams. The pair shared the willingness to shock and be unconventional in their stand-up work. But the British comic is not the only one benefiting from the trails Williams blazed. On Tuesday, all the late-night hosts -- Jimmy Fallon, Seth Meyers and Conan O'Brien -- took time to honor Williams and share their memories. All expressed their joy in watching him perform and their sadness that he succumbed to his demons. \"I think it's particularly courageous for someone to be that generous of spirit in the face of that kind of depression,\" O'Brien said. Chris Rock, who is known for his edgy, political humor, told ABC that Williams was \"one of the funniest guys I ever saw in my life.\" \"I remember the first time I saw 'Mork & Mindy,' \" Rock said. \"And I know this sounds weird, it was like watching, it was the first time I saw an actual human being be as funny as Bugs Bunny. You know what I mean? Like he wasn't human in a sense. When they (cast) him as an alien it was perfect because he was so from another world.\" Hollywood can be competitive, but Rock said Williams was warm and always supportive of his colleagues. \"I never heard that guy trash, you know, comedians sit around and trash each other all day,\" Rock said. \"I never heard Robin Williams say anything remotely bad about any comedian. He has such a respect for the art form in general at all levels.\" Like Williams, \"Let's Make a Deal\" host and comic Wayne Brady enjoys a career built on being the funny, approachable guy. Brady paid homage to the star who -- despite being an Academy Award winner -- took the time to do a duet with him on the improv show \"Whose Line Is It Anyway?\" \"Getting to work with him was a life high,\" Brady tweeted.\" \"U don't get to meet the ppl you look up to very often, and I'm glad to say he never disappointed.\" Mindy Kaling, \"The Mindy Project\" star who has made a career of exploring American culture, shared a special connection with Williams and his place in pop culture. \"I am named after a character from a Robin Williams TV show when my parents still lived in Africa,\" she tweeted. \"He meant so much, to so many, so far away.\" \"Girls\" star and creator Lena Dunham tweeted that she had \"(just) shared a moment of silence on the set for Robin Williams, a man who brought so much laughter, joy and healing to so many.\" \"Moved reading so many reminiscences of Robin Williams, the multitude of things he represented to diverse people of different generations,\" Dunham also tweeted. \"In an age of reality TV and TMZ it's a reminder of what entertainment can do: make us laugh, cry, feel known.\" Williams' influence spread around the globe. Artists paid tribute to him at the Edinburgh festival, a major arts and cultural gathering held every summer in Scotland. American comic and satirist Will Franken told The Guardian that Williams mentored him. Franken said that upon finding out that his son had struck up a friendship with the legendary actor, Franken's father, a Vietnam War veteran, \"made sure I conveyed to Robin how much his performance in 'Good Morning Vietnam' meant to him.\" \"In the short time I knew him, we used to share our experiences of those comedic demons of jealousy and envy,\" Franken said. \"Over coffee one afternoon, he told me that we were lucky we got to do what we did for a living, because a lot of people just had to sit with their own craziness. But we got to show off our insanity on the stage and get it out there.\""}

In Washington, DC, as a whole, Zillow's Home Value Index (ZHVI) rose almost 13.6 percent — to $397,000, from $349,600 — between January 2009 and November 2012, according to NBC.com. Meanwhile home values fell nationally by roughly 5.3 percent over the same period, to $156,200 in November 2012, the site reports. The monthly payment - on a fixed rate 30-year mortgage - for the White House would be $1,130,832, assuming a 20 per cent deposit and 3.276 per cent interest rate, according to Zillow.

{"prompt": "ABC anchor Amy Robach revealed on Good Morning America today she has breast cancer and will undergo a double mastectomy on Thursday. In September, the 40-year-old mother-of-two was asked by the producer of the show if she would take a mammogram live on air to raise awareness for breast cancer for their 'GMA Goes Pink' day. She reluctantly agreed - and it was a decision that saved her life. On October 1, in front of millions of people, Robach took her mammogram, breathing a sigh of relief when it was over. She remembered Robin Roberts - herself a breast cancer survivor - telling her: 'If you get the mammogram and it saves just one life then it's all worth it.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sad news: Amy Robach, 40, announced on GMA that she has breast cancer and needed to undergo a double mastectomy . Brave: Amy credits ABC and Robin Roberts for saving her life because she only had a mammogram when being asked by the show's producers . Staying positive: After an on-air mammogram revealed that she had a tumor in one of her breasts, further tests revealed that she had a second tumor, more abnormal cells and the cancer had spread to her lymph nodes . Breast cancer: Amy received an on-air mammogram on October 1 (pictured above), after realizing she is the age when she should be getting tested regularly but had been putting it off because she was busy with work and her family . Famous friends: Amy with her husband, Melrose Place actor Andrew Shue, left, and Grant Show, right . Little did she know the life she would be saving would be her own. A mammogram is an x-ray picture of the breast which is used to check for cancer in women who have no signs or symptoms of the disease. It allows the doctor to have a closer look for changes in breast tissue that cannot be felt during a breast exam. It can help reduce the number of deaths from breast cancer in women aged 40 to 70. Mammograms have been controversial and some women have been reluctant to go through with the screening. Potential harm includes false-negative results, false-positive results, over-diagnosis, over-treatment, and radiation exposure. During a mammogram, your breasts are placed between an x-ray plate and a plastic plate which are then attached to the x-ray machine before the breasts are flattened. This spreads the breast tissue out to obtain a clearer picture. Pressure will be felt on the breast for a few seconds and there might be some discomfort but this will only last a few seconds. The whole procedure from start to finish lasts for 20 minutes. A few weeks later, she was asked to come back to the doctors and was so unconcerned, she didn't even bring anyone with her. 'I thought I was going back in for a . few follow-up images, only to find out in a matter of hours that I had . breast cancer,' Amy wrote on her ABC blog. 'I was alone that afternoon, never thinking to bring anyone with me, never thinking that day would be life-altering. 'My . husband was on a business trip and my parents live across the country, . but that night everyone flew into New York City and we started gearing . up for a fight.' She spoke on GMA this morning about . the experience and how it has affected her and her family. 'Robin Roberts and ABC saved my life by telling me to go into that van for a mammogram. 'When I was asked, I want to say I was happy to do my part but honestly I was a little reluctant at first. I'd been asked to do it on air to demystify it for women who might be nervous. 'I'm 40 and I had been putting it off for a number of years - between flying all over the world for work and running around with my kids to school, ballet and gymnastics. Like so many women I just kept pushing it off. 'Telling my children was the toughest part and yesterday I had to tell my grandmother - who is not in the best of health. 'I have to be strong now for other people because I am about to break their hearts.' By her side: Amy Robach's husband Andrew Shue was there at the ABC studios to support his wife as she made the heartbreaking announcement . Alone: Amy said she did not even bring her husband Andrew to the second appointment with the doctor because she thought it was nothing . Family: Amy said she is being strong for her children because she realizes telling them she has cancer will break their hearts . Driving force: Robach, 40, chose the most aggressive form of treatment- a double mastectomy- because she has young children and much to live for, saying she didn't want the chance of a second bout hanging over her . She wrote on her blog: 'On Thursday, November 14, I will go into surgery where my doctors will perform a bilateral mastectomy followed by reconstructive surgery. 'Only then will I know more about what that fight will fully entail, but I am mentally and physically as prepared as anyone can be in this situation. 'And while everyone who gets cancer is clearly unlucky, I got lucky by catching it early, and there are so many people to thank for making sure I did. 'Every producer, every person who urged me to do this, changed my trajectory. The doctors told me bluntly: \"That mammogram just saved your life\".' Amy married her second husband - Melrose Place actor Andrew Shue - in 2010 after meeting him at a book party. She has two daughters to her first husband Tim McIntosh, who she divorced in 2009. Before she moved to ABC, Amy was the Today show weekend host. She left NBC in May 2012. Robin Roberts returned to GMA in February this year, left, still sporting a bald head from chemotherapy and right, back to her usual self at the Country Music Awards last week . Together again: Roberts introduced the show and grinned alongside her fellow GMA hosts in February . Robin Roberts recently returned to Good Morning America after her own battle with breast cancer. She was first diagnosed in 2007 after discovering a lump during a self-examination. She also made the brave decision to announce her illness on air. What followed was a partial mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiation until she finally got the all clear. Then in 2012, she was diagnosed with MDS or myelodysplastic syndrome, which is a disease of the blood and bone marrow which was once known as pre-leukemia. Be the Match Registry, a nonprofit organization run by the National Marrow Donor Program, experienced a 1,800 per cent spike in donors the day Roberts went public with her illness. She took a leave from GMA to get a bone marrow transplant in October 2012 but her recovery was documented on the morning show before she returned to GMA on February 20 of this year.

{"prompt": "David Moyes chalked up his first big win in Spain on Sunday night by beating the mighty Barcelona. He is not yet two months in to his La Liga adventure but the signs are that he can be a success in San Sebastian. Sportsmail looks at the story so far... Beating Barca as a springboard . Still beaming after Sunday night’s win, Moyes admitted post-match: ‘When we scored after two minutes I turned to my assistant Billy McKinlay and said: \"We could do with the final whistle coming now\". It was backs-against-the-walls stuff for most of the game but the resilience, intensity and defensive organisation that he has tried to instil in his new charges was there for all to see. David Moyes shakes hands with Lionel Messi after his Real Sociedad side beat Barcelona . Sergio Canales (right) and Xabier Prieto celebrate Sociedad's winner - a Jordi Alba own goal . The temptation from the club president Jokin Aperribay will now be not to spend in the January transfer market with the club very keen to make the most of its excellent youth system. But Moyes stressed on Sunday night: 'We need to add quality if we want to be at the top end of the table. I love the philosophy of the club and want to work within that but you also need experience.' The changes he has made . The first thing he noticed upon turning up in the Basque country last November was that the players were not fit. After a shambolic pre-season, not helped by having to play Europa League qualifiers, the players were not ready for the rigours of a tough season. ‘It’s not something you can change in the middle of a campaign,’ he said. ‘People will notice the difference in the coming months and definitely next season.’ He will have been delighted with how well they held out on Sunday night after fading badly in the second half of many games since he took over. He will also have been delighted with the defensive organisation. He can be seen, on the usually cold and wet training pitches of Zubieta, pulling his defenders into position as part of the defensive drills he has leaned heavily upon since his arrival to bring some order to the team. Apart from a nightmare second half against Villarreal when they conceded four, the side have been very hard to score against under Moyes. Moyes has put in plenty of work in on the training pitch and Sociedad are beginning to reap the benefits . Settling in . He is still staying in the city’s Maria Cristina hotel which overlooks the Uruma river as it meets the Atlantic (hence no rush to find permanent accommodation) but he is keen to pick out a family home as he puts down roots in one of the most picturesque regions of Spain. It rains a lot and it stays colder than most other parts of the peninsula so there is no beating sun to hide from. Moyes wants to make the often inclement conditions at the club’s Anoeta Stadium part of Real Sociedad’s armoury – other teams don’t want to visit northern Spain; Barcelona didn’t much fancy the 9pm kick-off on Sunday and Moyes sees that as a potential advantage. Talking a good game . He is taking lessons but the enormity of learning another language aged 51 when you are also a full-time football manager has already hit home. Pep Guardiola had a German teacher shadow him for the six months that led up to him taking the reins at Bayern Munich, Carlo Ancelotti locked himself away for several weeks before beginning his English adventure at Chelsea and others like Jose Mourinho have been fluent in other languages since school age. Scotsman Moyes wears a Sociedad scarf during his unveiling at the Anoeta back on November 13 . Moyes shares a joke with the media during a press conference to preview the Barcelona match .

Dec 14: Athletic Bilbao (H), La Liga, D 1-1 . Dec 17: Real Oviedo (H), Copa del Rey, W 2-0 . Dec 20: Levante (A), La Liga, D 1-1 . Jan 4: Barcelona (H), La Liga, W 1-0 . Overall: P8 W3 D4 L1 F8 A6 . Moyes is determined but it will not be easy. His ‘dos, tres, cuatro times’ press conference effort became an internet hit and he also shouted out ‘Stefano!’ when there is no such player at Real Sociedad during his first match. But the main thing is that he is making the effort and the effort is being appreciated. Many of Real Sociedad’s players speak English. Former QPR midfielder Esteban Granero has already told Sportsmail that Moyes’ English is easier to understand that Harry Redknapp’s so there seems to be no great communication problem. A translator is at Moyes’ side during training sessions and press officer Luis Arconada (son of the great Spain and Real Sociedad goalkeeper) is also fluent and constantly on hand to help the new manager. What the future holds . He has already stressed the priority is to pull away from the bottom and not be in a relegation dog-fight at the end of the season. But he is always well aware that only last season La Real were playing in the Champions League so he needs to push them back towards the top four as soon as possible. To do that he will need to be allowed to bring in quality this January. The club are very keen to use its excellent B-team youth side Sanse. Moyes buys into the philosophy because he knows it well from his Everton days but he is also keen to be allowed to go out and get a Tim Cahill or Mikel Arteta just to add that extra touch of quality and experience. Moyes is hoping that the San Sebastian club will back him in the transfer market during the January window ."}
{"prompt": "By . Emma Innes . PUBLISHED: . 12:42 EST, 2 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:11 EST, 2 September 2013 . Surgeons have used ground-breaking 3D technology to help rebuild a patient’s face after she developed a life-threatening tumour behind her eye. Ann O’Sullivan , 69, visited her GP about a sinus problem only to discover her headaches were actually caused by an aggressive tumour that had been spreading undetected across the left side of her face. Maxillofacial surgeons at St George’s Hospital, in Tooting, South London, had to remove a large portion of her jaw, her left eye, and numerous teeth to get rid of the cancer. Ann O'Sullivan had to have part of her jaw, her left eye and some of her teeth removed after doctors found a tumour spreading across her face. Image shows a 3D scan of her face . Once this procedure was complete, they began the painstaking work of reconstructing of her face using innovative computer technology to rebuild the damaged area. The technology allowed the team to electronically scan the opposite side of her face to build a 3D profile that surgeons could then replicate. Mrs O’Sullivan said: ‘I’ve always been healthy so it came as a shock when the doctor referred me to hospital where the scan revealed a tumour. The hardest thing to take was the loss of my left eye. ‘The surgeons told me it was just rotten luck but that I was lucky the tumour had been growing outwards rather than inwards. ‘My father died of cancer but I was told that many types of cancer were now curable as long as they are caught early enough.’ Mrs O'Sullivan said: ¿The hospital offered me a false eye but I don¿t want that. I¿m as fixed as I¿m going to be and that¿s good enough¿ . Mrs O’Sullivan underwent a ten-hour operation at the hospital’s specialist maxillofacial unit which specialises in reconstructive surgery including facial trauma, deformity and head and neck cancer. The operation involved surgeons taking a portion of bone from her leg to reconstruct her jaw, and a number of tissue grafts where arteries and veins had to be painstakingly re-connected using micro surgery. A complication saw Mrs O’Sullivan return to surgery a day later for a further ten hour operation before surgeons were satisfied that blood was circulating properly to the affected area. She said: ‘I can’t praise the staff enough. They kept me informed every step of the way and have been very caring and kind from the surgical team to the nurse who bought me a cup of tea in the small hours of the morning. ‘I put my faith in the hospital and they saved my life.’ Mrs O’Sullivan, who lives in Roehampton, says it took her a week before she had the courage to look at herself in the mirror. ‘I told myself it could have been worse and am now focused on getting on with my life. You have to be positive. ‘The hospital offered me a false eye but I don’t want that staring back at me every morning. I’m as fixed as I’m going to be and that’s good enough.’ Mrs O’Sullivan says her family have been a great source of support. Mr Kavin Andi, one of two surgeons involved in the operation, said: ‘It’s always satisfying to see a procedure go well and return people to their home environment so they can get on with their lives.’ Mr Andi and Mr Graham Smith, who was supported in theatre by a team of more than ten clinicians and nurses, said the use of 3D imaging meant much of the preparatory work was carried out ‘virtually’ on a computer so he knew exactly what needed to be done before going into surgery. He added: ‘We are lucky at St George’s because we are a world leader in this field of work. The 3D imaging means I can look at the tumour from different angles and take the necessary measurements including how and where bone is removed and re-sculpted. ‘I am particularly pleased because Ann was allowed to go home on the pre-agreed date, despite the extra operation.’ Mrs O’Sullivan is now undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy at the Royal Marsden, in Sutton."}

Compared to the present-day \"Simpsons\" clan, the Ullman Simpsons are crudely drawn, paler, misshapen, and vocally forgettable. As part of \"The Simpsons'\" annual \"Treehouse of Horror\" Halloween special this year, today's Simpsons will meet the Ullman Simpsons ... and then massacre each other. 'Simpsons' likely killing off Krusty the Clown . \"We've implied that they were murdered and buried under the house, so this is expanding that thought,\" producer Al Jean told Entertainment Weekly about the Ullman Simpsons. \"If people want a real Halloween bloodbath, they get it.\" The old school Simpsons had made tongue-in-cheek cameos on the show throughout the years, but this is the first time the two versions of the same family will interact at length. 'The Simpsons' marathon shattered FXX ratings . The Halloween episode will also sport the characters' original voices. According to Jean, the voice actors had to remember how their characters originally sounded during the Ullman years and resurrect that, sometimes in conversation with their present-day counterparts. \"It was really funny to get the interplay [between the two versions of the Simpsons] and for the actors to see the voice evolution,\" Jean said. \"The great thing is we didn't have to ask â€” we already had the cast hired for the 'Tracey Ullman' Simpsons.\" The Ullman Simpsons aren't the only unlikely family the Simpsons will meet this season: As previously reported, this season will feature a \"Simpsons\"/\"Family Guy\" mash-up.

{"prompt": "Shoppers made their feelings clear about an EU ban on models of more than 1,600 watts by visiting stores or online sellers in their droves . The stampede to buy powerful vacuum cleaners intensified yesterday as retailers reported a fourfold surge in sales. Shoppers made their feelings clear about an EU ban on models of more than 1,600 watts by visiting stores or online sellers in their droves. Many have been stockpiling two or more high-power models to beat regulations that came into effect yesterday. The new EU directive is intended to reduce energy use, but it has infuriated the public, who say they’ll have to spend longer using the appliances. Online electrical retailer ao.com said weekly sales had soared 380 per cent compared with the first week of August. The most popular model was the 2,400-watt Bosch Pro Energy BSGL3126GB cylinder vacuum cleaner costing £99, which sold out yesterday. It currently has two models left in stock that are over 1,600 watts, but expects to have more this week. There was clear evidence of customers stockpiling vacuums, it added, particularly in the 2,000+ watt ranges, where 3 per cent of sales were generated by shoppers buying two or more. ‘We saw a huge surge in sales of corded vacuums over 1,600 watts over the weekend, with sales quadrupling,’ said head of small domestic appliances Leanne Beswick. ‘Having reviewed our stocking levels it looks like we still have a limited number of high wattage vacuum cleaners in our warehouse and we are expecting another two models to come back into stock this week.’ Sales at the Cooperative Electrical Shop over the past two weeks leapt by 129 per cent compared with the same period last year. Currys said sales were up 94 per cent compared with the same weekend 12 months ago. A spokesman added: ‘They have been flying off the shelves and that has been across the board – from uprights to cylinders.’ Scroll down for video . Under threat: Food blenders may also be targeted . Some 30 devices – mostly domestic electrical items – are facing overhauls to meet the EU guidelines, including: . Air conditioning in cars – blamed for increasing fuel consumption although critics point out the drag created by opening a window uses more energy. Window heaters and seat heating will also be looked at. Fitness equipment – many modern exercise bikes and rowing machines use electricity to generate resistance. Hairdryers – power savings of 30 per cent may be required, although salons argue they will spend longer drying hair. Blenders – smoothies and soups may take longer to prepare if new rules are introduced. Fax machines – under scrutiny despite all but dying out in homes as people switch to email. Photocopiers, printers and scanners are on the list too. Power tools – they could face changes despite the Commission’s report stating the potential improvements are ‘small’. Lawnmowers – all types, including electrical and petrol, could be affected. Patio heaters – a key target due to the amount of energy lost. Kettles – may have to be redesigned to switch off sooner or slash surface heat loss. Toasters – they waste power if one or more slots is empty. Tesco has previously reported sales rocketing by 44 per cent over the past fortnight with models selling out including the 2,300-watt Hoover Breeze BR2306. Argos said it had seen an increase in sales despite 97 per cent of its stock being compliant with the new legislation since July. Retailers can continue selling existing stock until it runs out but they cannot import more and manufacturers are no longer allowed to produce them. Vacuums will also have to carry ratings from A to G similar to those on fridges and washing machines, explaining energy use, cleaning performance on carpets and hard floors, and dust emissions. The crackdown affects five of the seven vacuums given ‘Best Buy’ status by Which?, and the consumer watchdog last week advised people to ‘act quickly’ before stocks of powerful models run out. A 2012 report by retail analyst Mintel found 76 per cent of consumers rated suction power the most important feature when buying a vacuum. Senior household care analyst Richard Caines said: ‘I’m not 100 per cent convinced it will save a lot of energy as if a vacuum is not providing as much suction it will have to be used for longer.’ The power of cleaners will be reduced further from 2017, when the maximum will be 900 watts."}
{"prompt": "Today's Millennials could be tomorrow's very sweaty retirees thanks to temperatures and humidity levels that are rising so fast that, by the end of this century, simply going outside could be deadly. ‘As temperatures rise, toward the end of the century, less than an hour of activity outdoors in the shade could cause a moderately fit individual to suffer heat stroke,’ said climatologist Robert Kopp of Rutgers University, lead scientific author of the shocking report 'Risky Business.' ‘That's something that doesn't exist anywhere in the world today.’ The study's alarming findings put into sharp perspective not just what rising global temperatures can mean to today's youth but also how the overlooked factor of rising humidity--which makes already killer temperatures even deadlier--will also come to make summertime progressively miserable and dangerous. Sooner than you think: The study found that huge regions of the U.S. will have humity/heat levels so high that even moderately fit individuals will not be able to safely go outdoors by 2200 if carbon emissions continue at today's levels . The body's capacity to cool down in hot weather depends on the evaporation of sweat. That keeps skin temperature below 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 Celsius). Above that, core temperature rises past 98.6F. But if humidity is also high, sweat cannot evaporate, and core temperature can increase until the person collapses from heat stroke. ‘If it's humid you can't sweat, and if you can't sweat you can't maintain core body temperature in the heat, and you die,’ said Dr Al Sommer, dean emeritus of the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University and author of a chapter on health effects in the new report. The highest heat-plus-humidity reading in the United States was in 1995 in Appleton, Wisconsin, when the outside temperature was 101F. While the Upper Midwest is not known for tropical conditions, climate research shows that it will experience more warming than lower latitudes as well as more humidity. As a result, the deadliest heat-and-humidity combinations are expected to center around that region, with threads reaching to the Eastern Seaboard and islands of dangerous conditions along the northwest Pacific coast. Sweaty retirement: Study researchers created this graphic, which indicates how many days per year there will be temperatures of 95F or above in the United States as today's Millennials age into tomorrow's retirees . The study found that if you're between 4 and 33-years-old today, dozens or hundreds of days (depending where you live) each year will have temperatures at or above a sweltering 95F. As humidity rises along with temperature, the Midwest especially will become espcially dangerous as even moderately fit individuals staying in the shade could suffer heat stroke within an hour. With the air fully saturated with water, humans can no longer sweat as a means of evaporating off body heat. Under those extreme conditions, heat stroke can occur. The symptoms of this condition include dizziness, disorientation, confusion and sluggishness, skin the is dry and hot, rapid heartbeat and hallucinations. For the young, sick and elderly, the problem will be compounded. Startling maps released with the study show how over time a wider and larger portion of the United States will see more and more days of the year in which the conditions are simply too dangerous to go outdoors. If emissions continue unabated at their current rate, heat and humidity will be so high across nearly all the United States east of the Mississippi that people will not be able to safely leave their air conditioned homes for 10 percent of the year by 2200. With a medium reduction in emissions, the maps appears far less startling, with dangerous humidity-heat days down to around three of five per year, mostly in the Midwest. With large emissions reductions now, the study claims that all the U.S. will be safe from those dangerous years in 2200. Dangers: This National Weather Service heat index charts the deadly duo of heat and humidity, a tragic team that Americans will likely see affecting them more and more . If climate change continues on its current trajectory, the report concluded, Midwesterners could see deadly heat-and-humidity pairings (which meteorologists call ‘wet-bulb temperature’) two days every year by later this century. ‘It will be functionally impossible to be outside, including for things like construction work and farming, as well as recreation,’ said climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer of Princeton University. Even without killer humidity, heat waves are expected to take a larger and larger toll. The Southeast is expected to be hit with an additional 17 to 52 extremely hot days per year by mid-century and an additional 48 to 130 days by 2100. That could prove deadly for thousands: ‘Risky Business’ projects an additional 15 to 21 deaths per 100,000 people every year from the heat, or 11,000 to 36,000 additional deaths at current population levels."}

I agree I was about eight inches outside the bay on the passenger side - I hadn't noticed. 'But the car park was less than five per cent full so I wasn't inconveniencing anyone and as this was late afternoon the car park wasn't going to get any fuller. 'Now I have been stung with a £100 fine for my being the two hand-widths out of line. This is absurd.

One person died from injuries sustained in the wreck that closed a seven-mile section of Interstate 70 west of Indianapolis, Indiana State Police Capt. Dave Bursten said Friday. A hazardous materials team was cleaning up fuel and automobile lubricants from the roadway, Myers said. Wintry white-out conditions are one possible cause for the wreck, James said. A semi tractor and trailer hauling three elephants slid off the roadway at the crash scene, but the animals were not injured, authorities said. The elephants were never loose. In Michigan, three people were killed and up to 20 injured in another chain-reaction accident Thursday, state police said. Two children and one adult died, police said. The accident happened over the Rouge River Bridge in Detroit on Interstate 75, said Robert Morosi of the Michigan Department of Transportation. At least 30 cars were involved in the pileup, he said. Snow was falling at the time of the crash, Morosi said, describing conditions as a \"typical Michigan winter morning.\" The jaws of life were used to pull people out of three vehicles, Shaw said.

{"prompt": "Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- If you're trying to find a job these days, it might help to get rid of your cigarette habit. A hospital in the Atlanta suburbs is the latest employer nationwide that is refusing to hire smokers. Gwinnett Medical Center instituted the policy July 1, but other hospitals, including Cleveland Medical Center in Ohio, also have the policy. The Scotts Miracle-Gro Co., the lawn-care giant, hasn't hired smokers since 2006. Steve Nadeau, Gwinnett Medical Center senior vice president of human resources, said the policy is an extension of their efforts to promote better health. \"We believe it's just supporting good health, we're a health care provider,\" Nadeau said. \"We've had a smoking prohibition inside ... and outside and it's just really kind of a natural evolution,\" he said. Existing employees who smoke will not be fired. The medical center offers smoking cessation classes and has plans to revamp signage throughout their facility. Nadeau said the response from focus groups and employees has been \"good.\" \"We hope it won't mean we will lose good employees, but I have no doubt there are going to be folks we won't be able to get. From a policy standpoint it's the right direction for us,\" he said. But Dr. Michael Siegel, a Boston University professor of public health, said the policy is an invasion of privacy and keeps qualified medical professionals away. \"From personal experience as a physician, some of the best nurses happen to be smokers,\" Siegel said. \"Are you willing to hire staff that is not the best qualified simply because you're trying to make this point about how bad smoking is?\" Siegel, who is quick to note he supports smoke-free workplaces, said \"regulating someone's private behavior in their own home ... really represents employment discrimination and has nothing to do with qualifications for the job. If the hospital is so concerned about health, you can make the exact same argument about overweight people.\" The rate of smoking among physicians is low, Siegel said. But the rate among nurses is more than 20 percent -- higher than the general population. \"This policy will result in the hospital not hiring the most qualified people. You're eliminating 20 percent of the population,\" he said. The National Institute of Business Management's website reports that as of 2007, laws in 30 states and the District of Columbia prohibit employers from discriminating against employees or applicants based on the person's off-duty use of tobacco. Gary Nolan, a spokesman for Citizens Freedom Alliance: The Smoker's Club, is annoyed by the ban but supports private businesses' right to hire anyone they want. \"If you go in for heart surgery, do you really care if your surgeon smokes?\" Nolan said. But in Ohio, Cleveland Clinic officials say the hiring ban in place since 2007 is a success. \"It was a policy directive by our CEO (Dr. Delos Cosgrove) who wanted to fully enhance the idea of a health institution being what it says it is -- a healthy place to work,\" said Dr. Paul Terpeluk, Medical Director of Employee Health. \"He felt health care workers shouldn't be smokers.\" Since the policy began, 250 potential employees have failed the drug test for nicotine. Cleveland hires 5,000 employees a year, Terpeluk said. Those who fail the test can reapply in 90 days. \"It does make sense if you're a health care institution, you want everyone to be as healthy as possible,\" he said, adding that employees are also given incentives to lose weight. Hospital officials don't think the policy affects the quality of employees they hire. \"Cleveland Clinic is a center of excellence and when people apply here they really want to come work at this institution. We don't want smokers. It's not in line with our caregiver mission,\" he said. Industries outside health care have also dabbled in banning smokers from employment. Scotts Miracle-Gro not only bans smokers from employment, it fires employees who smoke. Jim King, senior vice president of corporate affairs, said the self-insured company decided smokers' heath care costs were too high. \"Like everybody else, we were looking at wellness and health care and the drivers of health care costs,\" King said. Before the policy, 30 percent of Scotts' 8,000 employees smoked. Now that number is less than 7 percent."}

This is a difficult and unprecedented task -- and we're learning as we go.\" The measure of success in war has changed, he said. \"In the past ... there were public surrenders, a signing ceremony on the deck of a battleship, victory parades in American cities. Today, when the war continues after the regime has fallen, the definition of success is more complicated.\" Nonetheless, he said, in Iraq and Afghanistan, there is a clear definition of success: when those countries are rid of al Qaeda, when they are economically viable, when they are democracies that can govern effectively and when they are strong allies on the war on terror. \"These successes will come,\" he told the class. \"And when they do, our nation will have achieved victory, and the American people will be more secure. \""}

{"prompt": "(CNN) -- Doctors say Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is on her way to a full recovery after a blood clot was found in her head on Sunday night. She was discharged from New York Presbyterian Hospital on Wednesday after spending three days being treated, the State Department announced. Clinton's blood clot was located in the vein between the brain and skull behind her right ear, according to her doctors' statement. It is being treated with blood thinners and did not result in a stroke or any neurological damage. This type of blood clot is called a cerebral vein thrombosis and is relatively rare, said Dr. Mary Cushman, director of the Thrombosis and Hemostasis Program at the University of Vermont and chair of the American Society of Hematology's subcommittee on quality of care. A two-year study conducted in the Netherlands found cerebral vein thrombosis affects approximately 1 in every 100,000 people. In comparison, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 1 in 1,000 people are affected by deep venous thrombosis (DVT) -- a similar clot found most often in the leg. Clinton, now 65, suffered from a DVT in 1998. Anyone who has had a blood clot in the past is at a higher risk of getting one again. About one-third of people with DVT will have a recurrence within 10 years, according to the CDC. \"There are a handful of genetic conditions that predispose someone to these kinds of clots,\" Cushman said. \"That's why you might see two different (types of blood clots) in the same person.\" It's unknown if Clinton has a genetic condition that may increase her risk. Other risk factors for DVT include smoking, use of oral contraceptives, age (the risk increases over age 65) and obesity. Blood clots: 4 things you need to know . A large long-term study published in the journal PLoS One in 2007 found the more frequently a person travels, the higher their risk of blood clots. The blood in veins is fighting gravity to get back to the heart, Cushman said, and needs the leg muscles to help push it along. When a person is sedentary for long periods of time -- especially on a plane or in a car where the legs are in the same position for hours -- the blood can start to clot. Clinton has logged many miles as secretary of state, in addition to the time spent traveling as a former presidential candidate and first lady. Although she plans to step down from the State Department soon, there is a lot of speculation about a run for president in 2016. Blood clots wouldn't deter her from campaigning if that's what she chooses, said Dr. Jack Ansell, an expert in thrombosis at Lenox Hill Hospital who is not involved in Clinton's care. \"Travel is potentially an issue for the secretary, but I would imagine that when she travels she's not sitting in a coach seat, cramped up and sitting still,\" Ansell said. Experts recommend anyone with a history of blood clots stand up and walk every couple hours during long trips. They should also avoid alcoholic drinks prior to traveling -- dehydration can contribute to the formation of blood clots. Doctors often recommend wearing compression stockings, which help move blood along in the legs by narrowing the veins. Clinton may remain on blood thinners for several months or for the foreseeable future, said Dr. Evan Lipsitz, chief of vascular surgery at Montefiore Medical Center, who is not treating the secretary of state. \"The current recommendations are for at least three months of treatment with a blood thinner following a clot. Each case much be individualized depending on the size and location of the clot and the risk of bleeding as a result of the treatment,\" Lipsitz said. Often patients on these medications are monitored closely, having their blood checked once a month or every couple of months to ensure the dosage is right. Lipsitz makes his patients aware of typical blood clot symptoms (sudden pain or swelling in the limbs, or chest pain and shortness of breath caused by a blood clot traveling toward the lungs) so they can spot them and get treated quickly. Patients on blood thinners need to avoid physical trauma, Cushman said, but are otherwise fine. So while an NFL player or a construction worker would probably be out, Clinton's career going forward is still full of possibilities. \"I think her future is as good as her past,\" Ansell said. \"She should recover fully and get back to work.\" CNN's Mary Snow, Danielle Dellorto and Elise Labott contributed to this report."}

The growing power of a rebel army has seen control of the Syrian capital of Damascus split between rival gunmen fighting for or against President Bashar Assad. Two days of bloody carnage in which at least 74 people have died has come as the rebel force - the Syrian Free Army - steps up its mission to take control of the streets from government forces. 'We had a big battle here earlier this month,' a Damascus schoolteacher, who did not want to be identified for fear of reprisals, told The Times. No go area for government soldiers: A Syrian soldier, who has defected to join the Free Syrian Army, brandishes a rifle and waves a Syrian independence flag in the Saqba istrict of Damascus .

All they can do now is cut the electricity and the water an disrupt the phone. It just goes to show how weak they are.' The head of Arab League observers in Syria said in a statement that violence in the country has spiked over the past few days. Sudanese General Mohammed Ahmed al-Dabi said the cities of Homs, Hama and Idlib have all witnessed a 'very high escalation' in violence since Tuesday. A 'fierce military campaign' was also under way in the Hamadiyeh district of Hama since the early hours of Friday, according to the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and other activists. However, the rebel surge has caused a spike in deaths that has claimed the lives of women and children as well as soldiers. In the besieged city of Homs forces loyal to President Bashar Assad shelled homes and fired on crowds with machine guns in a dramatic escalation of violence yesterday, according to activists. Massacre: The bodies of families that were killed during the bombing in Homs . Martyr: Syrians carry the coffin of Mazen abou Dhahab who was killed in a protest in Damascus . Running for their lives: This still image grabbed taken from a video uploaded on YouTube shows Syrians fleeing attack in the southern city of Daraa yesterday after fighting broke out at a funeral . Video of the massacre, posted online by activists, showed the bodies of five small children, five women of varying ages, and a man, all bloodied and piled on beds. It appears to be inside an apartment after a building was hit in the Karm el-Zaytoun neighbourhood of the city. A narrator said an entire family had been 'slaughtered'. The Syrian uprising, which began last March with mostly peaceful protests, has become increasingly violent in recent months as army defectors clash with government forces and some protesters take up arms to protect themselves. The violence has inflamed the sectarian divide in the country, where members of Assad's Alawite sect dominate the regime despite a Sunni Muslim majority. Veto: An anti-regime demonstrator holds up a poster of Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin . Some residents spoke of another massacre that took place when shabiha - armed regime loyalists - stormed the district, slaughtering residents in an apartment, including children. 'It's racial cleansing,' said one Sunni resident of Karm el-Zaytoun. Elsewhere, a car bomb exploded at a checkpoint outside the northern city of Idlib, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said, quoting witnesses on the ground. In an attempt to stop the bloodshed, the UN Security Council was to hold a closed-door meeting to discuss the crisis, a step toward a possible resolution against the Damascus regime. The UN says at least 5,400 people have been killed in the government crackdown since March, and the turmoil has intensified as dissident soldiers have joined the ranks of the anti-Assad protesters. UN rights chief Navi Pillay, speaking at the Davos Forum in Switzerland, expressed 'great concern that the killings are continuing and in my view it's the authorities who are killing civilians, and so it would all stop if an order comes from the top to stop the killings'. Assad's regime claims terrorists acting out a foreign conspiracy are behind the uprising. International pressure on Damascus to end the bloodshed so far has produced few results. The Arab League has sent observers to the country, but the mission has been widely criticised for failing to stop the violence. Gulf states led by Saudi Arabia pulled out of the mission. The UN Security Council has been unable to agree on a resolution since violence began in March because of strong opposition from Russia and China. Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said that the text introduced by new Arab Security Council member Morocco has 'red lines' for Moscow, but he's willing to 'engage' with the resolution's sponsors. Anti-Russian sentiment is running high among rebel fighters because they believe Putin's government is preventing regime change in Syria, reviving Assad, as pictured in this creative protest banner . Churkin said those lines include any indication of sanctions, including an arms embargo. 'We need to concentrate on establishing political dialogue,' he said. Russia's discomfort with the wording of the resolution could be resolved if the document clearly rules out military intervention, said Fyodor Lukyanov, editor of the journal Russia in Global Affairs. But he said Western and Arab states were unlikely to dismiss the use of force entirely, which will not satisfy Moscow. With Arab states such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar determined to get Assad out of power and Russia opposed, he said, 'I cannot really see some resolution that could be agreed by all. 'This is not Libya, it's a completely different situation.'"}

For the first time, researchers in Philadelphia have found a way to completely delete the HIV virus (pictured) from human cells by ‘snipping’ them out. The process could also provide a cure for other latent infections . The team of Temple University School of Medicine said the breakthrough marks the first successful attempt to eliminate latent HIV-1 virus from human cells – and could be a cure for other latent infections. ‘This is one important step on the path toward a permanent cure for AIDS,' said Kamel Khalili, PhD, Professor and Chair of the Department of Neuroscience at Temple.

Researchers based the two-part HIV-1 editor on a system that evolved as a bacterial defence mechanism to protect against infection. When deployed, a combination of a DNA-snipping enzyme called a nuclease and a targeting strand of RNA called a guide RNA (gRNA) hunt down the viral genome and remove the HIV-1 DNA. Dr Khalili's lab engineered a 20-nucleotide strand of gRNA to target the HIV-1 DNA and paired it with a DNA-sniping enzyme called Cas9 and used to edit the human genome. From there, the cell's gene repair machinery takes over, soldering the loose ends of the genome back together – resulting in virus-free cells.

'Since HIV-1 is never cleared by the immune system, removal of the virus is required in order to cure the disease,' explained Dr Khalili. These molecular tools also hold promise as a therapeutic vaccine; cells armed with the nuclease-RNA combination proved impervious to HIV infection. Worldwide, more than 33 million people have HIV, including more than 1 million in the United States. Every year, another 50,000 Americans contract the virus, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In the UK, around 100,000 people were living with HIV in the UK in 2013. That’s around one person in 665. Although highly active antiretroviral therapy (Haart) has controlled HIV-1 for infected people in the developed world over the last 15 years, the virus can rage again with any interruption in treatment. Worldwide, more than 33 million people have HIV, including more than 1 million in the United States. ‘This is one important step on the path toward a permanent cure for AIDS,' said Kamel Khalili, PhD, Professor and Chair of the Department of Neuroscience at Temple . 'The low level replication of HIV-1 makes patients more likely to suffer from diseases usually associated with ageing,' Dr Khalili said. These include cardiomyopathy – a weakening of the heart muscle – bone disease, kidney disease, and neurocognitive disorders. 'These problems are often exacerbated by the toxic drugs that must be taken to control the virus,' Dr Khalili added.

'We are working on a number of strategies so we can take the construct into preclinical studies,' Dr Khalili said. 'We want to eradicate every single copy of HIV-1 from the patient. That will cure AIDS. I think this technology is the way we can do it.'"}

Timothy Jay Vafeades of Salt Lake City, Utah, has already been charged with kidnapping and abusing two women, one a relative, after he allegedly forced them to travel around the country in his truck while repeatedly having sex with him against their will. Vafeades, who wears fangs, named his truck the 'Twilight Express,' most likely in reference to the popular vampire series. Creep: Four new victims have come forward to say they were held as sex slaves by Timothy Jay Vafeades, a vampire-obsessed trucker who enjoys wearing fangs . New charges: Three of the new victims claim Vafeades used a Dremel power tool to grind down their teeth and one alleges he used an X-acto knife to give her new teeth . Now, four more woman have been identified as victims of the same alleged assaults. These new victims are making allegations very much similar to the two previous women, saying Vafeades, 54, took their cell phones and identification cards, forced them to shower and sleep naked with him, and beat them repeatedly while sexually assaulting them on a daily basis. Three of the victims also claim he used a Dremel power tool to grind off their teeth, and one alleges he took an X-acto knife to remove her teeth so she could wear false teeth. He also cut and dyed their hair and forced one woman to marry him. These new claims, which span from 1994 to as recently as 2013, come as federal prosecutors try and build up a case to use as evidence showing a pattern of behavior as they try Vafeades on charges related to his two most recent victims. According to the Salt Lake Tribune, Vasfeades' attorney is trying to have almost all of this evidence thrown out as he claims his client was unlawfully detained when officers first picked him up during a traffic stop in Minnesota. Behind bars: Vafeades is already being held without bail of kidnapping and assault charges related to two other victims, one a teenage relative . Caught: He was arrested at a truck stop in Minnesota (above) in November of 2013 when officers noticed his passenger, the teenage relative, was bruised and battered . It was during that stop that officers discovered his first victim, a 19-year-old relative of the man, that they claim was bruised and battered. Shortly after he was arrested, a second woman came forward with similar claims. Vafeades is also being charged with possession of child pornography after authorities found hundreds of child porn videos and images on his computer."}

A couple who spent a decade trying for a baby and endured seven stillbirths and miscarriages have finally had a healthy baby girl. Last year Sara Sills was fitted with a cervical stitch and baby Mabel was born in April. Despite being born three months prematurely, she has now been able to go home. Mrs Sills, 39, from Skellgate, North . Yorkshire, said: ‘My husband Chris and I call Mabel our \"rainbow baby” because after riding a . hard storm, there is always a rainbow, so she is definitely a miracle . and she means the world to us all.’ Sara and Chris Sills, both 39, went through seven miscarriages and stillbirths over a period of ten years before Mabel was born in April this year . Over the past ten years, Mrs Sills tried time and again to successfully carry a baby, but faced the agony of losing each of her seven babies - Samuel, Nathaniel, Emmanuel, Ruben, Gabriel, Rose and Matilda. Each of these pregnancies only survived up to 24 weeks so the couple faced a desperate wait to see if Mabel would survive. Mrs Sills, a former nursery nurse, said: ‘I didn't know anything about stillbirths and miscarriages until we went through it. ‘I would be fine and then sometimes I would have bleeds and sudden pains and my waters would just go. ‘I would then be in labour for weeks where I was prone to infection, and it proved too much for all of the babies. After her seventh miscarriage, Mrs Sills was fitted with a cervical stitch which strengthened her cervix enough to enable her to carry Mabel . Mabel was born three months prematurely weighing just 1lb 6oz and spent the first two months of her life in hospital . ‘Nothing can prepare you for a stillbirth. It's the silence that is the worst part. ‘Knowing you have been through a pregnancy, means you expect to have a baby at the end of it. You can't explain how hard it is. ‘Watching Chris was the hardest part because there was nothing he could do.’ Mr and Mrs Sills were already parents to Stefan, 19, Katie, 13, and Lily, 10, but felt they should keep trying for a fourth baby. ‘We always wanted a big family. We wanted four children and so we thought it was something we were meant to do so kept trying,’ said Mrs Sills. Mr and Mrs Sills say that they call Mabel their 'rainbow baby' because 'after riding a hard storm, there is always a rainbow' When Mrs Sills was carrying Mabel she was put on bed-rest at Sheffield Children's Hospital in an attempt to stop her waters breaking too early but she still went into labour when only 25 weeks pregnant . ‘At first we decided not to try again but then we just couldn't. Some people think it's strange that we kept trying but if we hadn't we wouldn't have Mabel here today.’ Despite having a normal birth with Stefan, both Katie and Lily were born prematurely but went on to become healthy children. After . the series of miscarriages, Mrs Sills was fitted with a cervical stitch, a procedure known as a tracheloplasty, which helps to strengthen the cervix and helps prevent . premature labour. She . said: ‘I was put on pure bed-rest at Sheffield Children's Hospital and . spent most of my pregnancy there in the hope it would stop my waters . breaking. ‘I went into labour with Mabel at 25 . weeks but I managed to hold on to her for another two weeks and she was . born by caesarean section. The couple, who also have three older children - Stefan, 19, Katie, 13, and Lily, 10 - were desperate to have a fourth baby because they had always wanted to have a big family . They say they will always remember the seven children they lost - Samuel, Nathaniel, Emmanuel, Ruben, Gabriel, Rose and Matilda. Mabel is pictured with her sisters, Lily, 10, (left) and Katie, 13, (right) ‘Mabel was delivered in a sack of fluid which was popped when she was born to make the birth less traumatic.’ She was born in April, weighing 1lb 6oz, however the family's fight was not over yet. Mr Sills, 39, a training consultant, said: ‘We spent weeks by her bedside, praying that she was going to survive. ‘The . fact that she had been born alive was a step forward for us and we . weren't prepared to let her go after all we had been through. ‘We . watched parents taking their babies home every day and we just dreamed . of the day we could take Mabel home. I think we always worried it would . never come.’ Now back at home, the family say they will never forget the seven members they lost. Mr and Mrs Sills say that on each of the stillborn children's birthdays they will light a candle to remember them . Mrs Sills said: ‘We will always remember our other children. We are always talking about them - it's healthy for the children. ‘We have special boxes and teddies that we have bought for each of them and on their birthdays we will light a candle to remember them by. ‘We buy them all cards and balloons which we let off into the sky as a way of reaching out to them, and at Christmas we put their decorations on the tree to remember them by. ‘A baby is still a baby, which I carried and won't forget just because they're not with us today. ‘We would not wish anyone to have to go through what we have been through, but we are pleased we kept trying. ‘She's a little miracle and we will never take forget how lucky we are.’"}
{"prompt": "(CNN) -- They are former Olympic doubles champions, but Switzerland's \"dream team\" of Roger Federer and Stanislas Wawrinka suffered another Davis Cup disaster on Saturday. Federer, a 17-time grand slam winner, and 2014 Australian Open champion Wawrinka crashed to a fourth successive defeat as a pairing in the international men's tennis tournament as unfancied Kazakhstan took a 2-1 lead in the quarterfinal tie. Andrey Golubev, who upset Wawrinka in Friday's singles, teamed up with debutant Aleksandr Nedovyesov to triumph 6-4 7-6 (7-5) 4-6 7-6 (8-6) in match lasting just under three hours in Geneva. \"It feels special. That was my first match for the Kazakhstan Davis Cup team,\" said Nedovyesov, whose only previous appearance in the competition was for his native Ukraine in 2005. The 27-year-old is ranked 76th in singles and 126th in doubles. \"They are Olympic champions but honestly it doesn't matter who I beat, I'm just proud of my team and proud of my country,\" he added. Russia-born Golubev, who is ranked 61st, continued his unbeaten run in the competition this season. \"Against those guys you have to play an almost perfect match and I'm happy we did that today,\" the 26-year-old said. Golubev, who won both singles matches in the opening round against Belgium, will play former world No. 1 Federer in what could be the decisive rubber on Sunday. Third-ranked Wawrinka will try to keep Switzerland's semifinal hopes alive in the first of the reverse singles when he takes on world No. 56 Mikhail Kukushkin -- also born in Russia. Federer and Wawrinka were playing together for their country for the first time this season, but had lost their previous three matches in 2011 and 2012 following Olympic success at Beijing 2008. \"I'm not overly worried about what happened the last couple of days,\" Federer said. \"We are good players and we are the favorites still for each singles reverse match but we have no more margin for error so we are aware of that and, who knows, that's maybe going to make us play even better, so I'm really excited about tomorrow.\" The winner of this tie will next play either Italy or Great Britain, which took a 2-1 lead in Naples after Andy Murray won his rain-delayed singles match and then returned to the clay court to triumph in the doubles. The world No. 8 completed a 6-4 7-5 6-3 win over Andreas Seppi before teaming up with Colin Fleming to beat Fabio Bognini and Simone Bolelli 6-3 6-2 3-6 7-5. Britain has not reached the semifinals since the World Group format was introduced in 1981, while Italy's last appearance was in 1998. The defending champion Czech Republic team marched into the last four after sealing an unbeatable 3-0 lead against Japan in Tokyo. Lukas Rosol and Radek Stepanek won 6-4 6-4 6-4 against Tatsuma Ito and Yasutaka Uchiyama to set up a clash with either France or Germany. Both teams are missing their No. 1 player, with Tomas Berdych absent for the Czechs and the injured Kei Nishikori out for Japan. France's hopes of a third semifinal in five years remain alive after Julien Benneteau and Michael Llodra beat Tobias Kamke and Andre Begemann 6-1 7-6 (7-5) 4-6 7-5 in Nancy. The visitors will seek to come from 2-0 down for the fourth time in the nation's competition history, having last done so against Italy in 1996. Meanwhile, Switzerland also suffered a defeat at WTA Tour tournament in Charleston, South Carolina on Saturday as highly-rated teenager Belinda Bencic lost in her first top-level semifinal. The 17-year-old upset Italian third seed Sara Errani at the Family Circle Cup on Friday, but could not repeat that form in another three-set match against Jana Cepelova. The 21-year-old Slovakian reached her first WTA final by triumphing 6-4 5-7 7-6 (9-7) on the green clay. Ranked 78th, she followed up shock wins over world No. 1 Serena Williams, Russian Elena Vesnina and compatriot Daniela Hantuchova. Cepelova will next play German Andrea Petkovic, who beat young Canadian sixth seed Eugenie Bouchard 1-6 6-3 7-5 in Saturday's opening semifinal. Bouchard beat former No. 1 Jelena Jankovic in her previous match but the 20-year-old -- who reached the Australian Open semifinals in January -- could not continue that form against Petkovic, a former top-10 player who is rebuilding her career after long-term injury problems."}
{"prompt": "(CNN) -- Last Wednesday, in a move that I still don't fully understand, I became a shareholder in the Spanish football club Real Oviedo. In terms of my relationship with football, I should probably lay my cards on the table. I am a Nottingham Forest fan. Anyone of a certain age with a passing interest in the game will understand that I'm familiar with disappointment. Having watched Forest fall from the heights of back-to-back European Cup wins to the depths of English football's third tier I know, all too well, the emotions involved in witnessing a distressing decline. This doubtless explains why some sense of faded glamour or a struggle against adversity tends to attract me to a club. To illustrate this point, my favorite Italian team is Sampdoria, currently lying 14th in Serie A. Winning, as they say, isn't everything. I realise this is perverse, but I've never been able to understand the appeal of supporting a football giant, going into a season in the confident expectation of wins and trophies. Jerry Maguire . So a couple of weeks ago, when I first heard of the plight of Oviedo, something clicked. I found myself Googling the club, reading about the city of Oviedo, admiring the jagged hills of Asturias. My attention was piqued by Sid Lowe, the British journalist whose animated appreciation of Spanish football has brought La Liga to life for many outside Spain. Lowe ignited the international campaign to save the club, while also warning that investors were highly unlikely to see any return. To paraphrase Jerry Maguire, he had me at 'unlikely'. Here was a potentially lost cause that I was powerless to resist. I stepped up my research and prepared to delve into the insanity of football club ownership. By the time I was ready to take the plunge, Real's global coalition of the willing had swelled considerably and the club was almost half way to safety. The share offer's website looked reassuringly professional, and was helpfully available in English. Estadio Carlos Tartiere . I had initially thought of just buying one share, but then I discovered that owning four shares would entitle me to attend the annual general meeting. Influence, I thought. I imagined myself turning up at the airport, being feted as an arriving hero and bought drinks in Oviedo's tapas bars just for being me. I rejected any thoughts that this scenario was somewhat far-fetched. I inputted my passport number, transferred the cash, sat back and enjoyed the warm glow of owning something of no apparent value whatsoever. The weird thing is that it really was a glow. I had another look at the impressive Estadio Carlos Tartiere and smiled to myself. I wondered how much flights would cost, and how I would persuade my wife that a weekend in Asturias was a good idea. I started following Oviedo types on Twitter. I re-tweeted a link to the club's soon-to-be-opened online shop. Mexican Tycoon . As the club's deadline day of November 17 approached, I kept an eye on the increasingly positive news coming from northern Spain; this people's club, now partly my club, looked close to completing its path to safety. Then came the news of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim's intervention. As a push over the line goes it could hardly be more emphatic, and suddenly the need to gather more shareholders became irrelevant. Oviedo was in the clear; 13,000 shareholders and the world's richest man had made it happen. However. I wasn't quite sure how I felt about this new development. The idea that a multi-billionaire was now bankrolling the club was anathema to me; I still feel that the age of the oligarch has done little but damage to football, at least in England. But it also opened up a world of possibilities.  Even Nottingham Forest have super-rich owners now, and at the City Ground the Al Hasawi family have appeared at pains to show the club's fans that they intend to do things \"the right way\". Maybe Carlos Slim would be the same. So far my only proof of ownership is my receipt from Paypal, which almost a week on makes me slightly uneasy but I hope is just a sign of how unbelievably successful this escapade has been for the club. I have a genuine feeling of being part of something, and a sense that this is the start of an exciting story. I also fully intend to make it to a game at the earliest available opportunity. I suppose I should probably think about how I explain to my wife that I've spent a chunk of our weekly shopping money on a Spanish third division football team. She's a Napoli fan; surely she'll understand? For now though I'm waiting patiently for my share certificate to arrive in the post. Whatever happens at the very least I have to buy a Real Oviedo mug."}

{"prompt": "Scientists have witnessed carbon dioxide trapping heat in the atmosphere above the United States, showing human-made climate change 'in the wild' for the first time. A new study in the journal Nature demonstrates in real-time field measurements what scientists already knew from basic physics, lab tests, numerous simulations, temperature records and dozens of other climatic indicators. They say it confirms the science of climate change and the amount of heat-trapping previously blamed on carbon dioxide. Scroll down for video . Scientists witnessed and measured carbon dioxide trapping heat in the sky above, confirming human-caused global warming, using the Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer seen here, located in Barrow, Alaska. This graph show carbon dioxide’s increasing greenhouse effect at a research facility in Oklahoma. As the atmospheric concentration of CO2 (blue) increased from 2000 to the end of 2010, so did surface radiative forcing due to CO2 (orange), and both quantities have upward trends. This means the Earth absorbed more energy from solar radiation than it emitted as heat back to space. The seasonal fluctuations are caused by plant-based photosynthetic activity. 'We see, for the first time in the field, the amplification of the greenhouse effect because there's more CO2 in the atmosphere to absorb what the Earth emits in response to incoming solar radiation,' said Daniel Feldman, a scientist in Berkeley Lab's Earth Sciences Division and lead author of the Nature paper. 'Numerous studies show rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations, but our study provides the critical link between those concentrations and the addition of energy to the system, or the greenhouse effect,' Feldman adds. He said no one before had quite looked in the atmosphere for this type of specific proof of climate change. The scientists used incredibly precise spectroscopic instruments operated by the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Climate Research Facility, a DOE Office of Science User Facility. These instruments, located at ARM research sites in Oklahoma and Alaska, measure thermal infrared energy that travels down through the atmosphere to the surface. They can detect the unique spectral signature of infrared energy from CO2. Other instruments at the two locations detect the unique signatures of phenomena that can also emit infrared energy, such as clouds and water vapor. The result is two time-series from two very different locations. Each series spans from 2000 to the end of 2010, and includes 3300 measurements from Alaska and 8300 measurements from Oklahoma obtained on a near-daily basis. Both series showed the same trend: atmospheric CO2 emitted an increasing amount of infrared energy, to the tune of 0.2 Watts per square meter per decade. This increase is about ten percent of the trend from all sources of infrared energy such as clouds and water vapor. Based on an analysis of data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s CarbonTracker system, the scientists linked this upswing in CO2-attributed radiative forcing to fossil fuel emissions and fires. The measurements also enabled the scientists to detect, for the first time, the influence of photosynthesis on the balance of energy at the surface. They found that CO2-attributed radiative forcing dipped in the spring as flourishing photosynthetic activity pulled more of the greenhouse gas from the air.

The combination of these measurements enabled the scientists to isolate the signals attributed solely to CO2. Scientists say carbon dioxide from the burning of coal, oil and gas is the chief cause of global warming. In doing so, the data show clouds, water vapor or changes in sun's radiation are not responsible for warming the air, as some who doubt mainstream climate science claim, Feldman said. The new study in the journal Nature demonstrates in real-time field measurements what scientists already knew from basic physics, lab tests, numerous simulations, temperature records and dozens of other climatic indicators. Nor could it be temperature data being tampered with, as some contrarians insist, Feldman said. 'The data say what the data say,' Feldman said. 'They are very clear that the rising carbon dioxide is actually contributing to an increased greenhouse effect at those sites.' The study is good technical work, said climate scientist Andrew Dessler of Texas A&M University, but it is expected — sort of like confirming gravity with a falling rock."}

This comes as it is revealed that a new TV version of her famous novel Pride and Prejudice is set to be aired next Christmas. Welsh actor Matthew Rhys will take on the role of Mr Darcy in new BBC adaptation Death Comes to Pemberley, a novel by crime writer PD James, which tells the story of Jane Austen’s Mr Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett six years after they married. Rhys, who has previously starred in Brothers and Sisters and The Mystery of Edwin Drood, has already admitted he faces a huge challenge to follow Firth’s 1995 portrayal of Mr Darcy. Mr Darcy: Matthew Rhys, left, will be taking the role of Jane Austen's heartthrob memorably played by Colin Firth n 1995, right . The 38-year-old said: ‘Exciting as it is, one of the challenges of a part such as Darcy are the comparisons that will be drawn to those who have institutionalised him in the past. ‘The beauty of Pemberley is that it is an entirely new and different Darcy six years on. 'And also, I don’t have to appear from a lake in a white shirt and breeches.’ Anna Maxwell Martin, who starred in The Bletchley Circle, will play Lizzie. Smouldering: Colin Firth in the famous wet shirt scene from the 1995 version . Popular role: Matthew MacFadyen also played Mr Darcy opposite Keira Knightley in the film from 2005 . The novel has been adapted into three one-hour programmes. Rhys will also follow in the footsteps of Spooks actor Matthew Macfadyen, who played Mr Darcy to Keira Knightley’s Lizzie in the 2005 film version of Pride and Prejudice. Filming for Death Comes to Pemberley will begin in Yorkshire in June."}

John Terry pokes home the opening goal for Chelsea against West Ham as Nemanja Matic stands in wait . Matic celebrates as his much-respected team-mate scores another goal for Premier League leaders Chelsea . Chelsea captain Terry, who scored for a second successive game, credits Diego Costa with the assist . Terry, who scored for a second successive game in Friday's 2-0 defeat of West Ham, is bidding to lead Chelsea to a fourth Premier League title in 10 seasons, but a first since 2010. 'John is a big player, he's our captain and he deserves everything,' Matic told Chelsea TV. 'He's one of the best central defenders in England ever. It's good to have him in the team. I hope he will continue for a few more years like this.' Should Terry's form continue it is likely his Chelsea career will be extended in the summer, but his primary focus is on the here and now. So, too, is Matic's ahead of Sunday's trip to Southampton, where Chelsea will bid to finish 2014 on a high and begin 2015 on top of the Barclays Premier League. Matic has become an integral part of Jose Mourinho's Chelsea side in the holding midfielder role . Matic tackles Hammers' dangerous striker Andy Carroll during their Boxing Day clash at Stamford Bridge . 'We are focused always on the next game,' Matic added. 'We look at this like a new challenge, like a new opportunity to show our quality and we will continue like this. 'We had some stretches in the dressing room (after the West Ham win) and we are already focused on Southampton. 'We will try to prepare ourselves for that game and I hope we will continue to win.'

{"prompt": "Philadelphia (CNN) -- A singer is being sought for questioning in connection with the death of a woman following a cosmetic procedure, police said Friday. Claudia Aderotimi, 20, died early Tuesday, shortly after receiving buttocks enhancements in a hotel room near Philadelphia International Airport, according to police. The procedure allegedly cost $1,800. Police say singer Black Madam -- whom they have identified as Padge Victoria Windslowe, 41 -- is believed to be the person who injected Aderotimi with a substance that was supposed to be silicone. Officers searched Windslowe's apartment for medical supplies, according to a search warrant. She was not home at the time, and authorities are looking for her. Aderotimi and three other women had traveled from England to undergo the cosmetic procedure in Philadelphia, police said. A woman who allegedly helped arrange the trip told police that \"Black Madam\" carried out the procedure, according to an affidavit. Shortly after the injection, Aderotimi became short of breath and complained of chest pains. She was rushed to a hospital, where she later died, police said. The preliminary cause of death has been linked to the injection, according to the affidavit. Underground cosmetic procedures have become a growing cause of concern for health regulators. Last month, New York officials arrested a woman for allegedly illegally injecting liquid silicone as part an underground business she ran out of her home, according to the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office. She allegedly charged more than $1,000 for a round of shots and faces up to three years in prison if convicted. Last year in New Jersey, state health officials launched an investigation into infections related to cosmetic injections after six women were hospitalized for complications. The women developed symptoms after injections for buttocks enhancement and received surgical and antibiotic treatment, according to the state health agency. All the injections apparently were administered by unlicensed medical providers. Investigators have had a difficult time tracking these procedures because they are performed by unlicensed providers. \"It's hard to tell how many people are utilizing that [type] of service,\" said Dr. Tina Tan, a New Jersey state epidemiologist. Tan has heard reports of caulk and other products being used in the injections, as well as injection substances being purchased outside of medical supply stores, she said. Not surprisingly, injecting these materials can result in serious health complications and death, she warned. \"In our cluster, these patients had to be hospitalized,\" she said, adding that injection procedures should be performed by licensed health providers. \"We do not recommend going in a hotel room with people who you don't know their credentials.\""}

Woods, who had back surgery to repair a pinched nerve in March, carded a three-over-par 74 in Thursday's opening round of the Quicken Loans National at the Congressional Country Club. Only seven times since turning professional in 1996 has the American golf star opened a PGA Tour event with a worse score. The 38-year-old is attempting to rebuild his game ahead of the third major of the season -- next month's British Open -- after missing the Masters in April and this month's U.S. Open. \"I think the hard part was just getting into the rhythm of playing competitively,\" Woods told reporters. \"You play with your buddies all day for cash and stuff but it's just not the same. It's not the same as tournament golf, different level. Adrenaline is rushing and I hit the ball further out here than I do at home. \"It unfortunately took a while to get the feel for it. My feels were off.\" The last of Woods' 14 major titles came at the 2008 U.S. Open, leaving him four behind Jack Nicklaus' overall record. The former world No. 1, now ranked fifth, has now missed six major championships through injury -- his absence at Augusta was the first time he'd not been at the Masters since making his debut there as an amateur in 1995. However, he said his back felt fine in his first round since the World Golf Championships event in Florida in March. \"I had no issues at all,\" he said. \"No twinges, no nothing. It felt fantastic.\" Woods has won the British Open three times, and the last of those came in 2006 at the host course of this year's tournament -- Royal Liverpool Golf Club at Hoylake, where the action will tee off on July 17. He bogeyed his first two holes at Congressional and dropped to last place in the field on six over par before three birdies in five holes gave his scorecard a healthier look, though he was eight shots behind first-round leader Greg Chalmers of Australia. \"I made so many little mistakes,\" Woods said. \"So I played a lot better than the score indicated, which is good.\" U.S. Open runner-up Erik Compton was tied for fourth in a group including Patrick Reed -- who won the WGC-Cadillac Championship where Woods last lined up."}
{"prompt": "(CNN) -- Bolivians are widely expected to approve a new constitution Sunday that would allow leftist President Evo Morales to run for another term this year, which he can't do under the current document. The new constitution would eliminate term limits and allow President Evo Morales to run again for president. The new constitution would replace the 1967 charter and give greater voice to the indigenous people who make up most of the country. It would also give more power to the central government. Morales, speaking at rallies in La Paz and Cochabamba this week, said the new document will propel the nation. \"Once approved, this will be the refoundation of Bolivia and the refoundation of a new state where there will be equality and we will all have the same rights and the same obligations,\" he said. Others say the referendum is a way for Morales to keep himself in power, a move that could plunge the country into further violence, division and uncertainty. That effort, critics say, is in ample evidence as some regions fight to break away and as the deaths of up to 30 peasant government supporters a few months ago led to accusations of a right-wing massacre. \"What will be opened is a new chapter of violence,\" said Carlos Toranzo, an investigator in La Paz with the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, a policy institute associated with the Social Democratic Party of Germany. As campaigning on Sunday's referendum came to a close Thursday with massive festive rallies for each side, Bolivians gave voice to the chasm that separates them. \"What this constitutional project does is divide us,\" said Fernanda San Martin, who was at the final opposition rally in the city of Santa Cruz. \"What it does is feed hate and racism in the country.\" Efrain Tico Quispe, at a rally in favor of the new constitution, sees it from a different perspective. \"For them, it's division. It doesn't benefit them,\" he said. \"But for humble people of our class, it serves us well.\" The referendum has two parts: a straight yes-or-no vote on adopting the new constitution and a question asking Bolivians whether the maximum amount of private property that can be owned should be 5,000 or 10,000 hectares (12,355 or 24,710 acres). The wide-ranging constitution would give the government a greater role in the economy and more control over natural resources, broaden nationalization of private industries and increase the rights of indigenous people. The new document also would eliminate term limits for all elected offices and would allow the president to run for re-election to a second consecutive five-year term. The current constitution limits the president to one five-year term. Under provisions of the new constitution, current terms would not be counted, so Morales could run in December and in 2014. In return for support for the constitution, Morales reportedly has agreed not to run in 2014 if he wins this year. But Morales, who was elected in December 2005 by the largest margin since civilian rule was restored in 1982, would still be in office for nine years. That part bothers those who see the vote as a way for Morales to keep himself in power. Peter Hakim, president of the Inter-American Dialogue policy institute in Washington, warns against politicians \"who use democracy to concentrate power.\" Sunday's vote comes after a long and troubled path that saw the referendum postponed three times. Morales, who campaigned on a promise to change the constitution, convened a constitutional assembly in July 2006, with a referendum scheduled for August 2007. The assembly did not have a draft document ready until December 2007. After much wrangling and accusations that opponents were locked out of crucial votes, the Bolivian congress approved a referendum in February 2008, scheduling it for May. But the government suspended that vote in March because some of the nation's nine departments, or states, wanted to hold local referendums on greater autonomy during the May balloting. In August, Morales said the referendum would be held in December. That vote also was postponed after unrest in Pando department in which pro-government peasants were killed. In October, an agreement was reached to hold the referendum January 25, 2009. Hakim and others understand why many Bolivians are eager for the vote, particularly in a country with 85 percent indigenous or mestizo lineage and only 15 percent white. \"There's a certain amount of ethnic identity that's involved. That's really important,\" said Peter DeShazo, director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \"People believe that somehow this is going to translate into something positive for their lives.\" A turning point came with the election of Morales, the nation's first Indian president. \"In Bolivia, you have a society that was very segregated,\" Hakim said. \"There was a lot of repression against Indian groups. There's a lot of impatience in the country. They feel that past governments have neglected them. They feel that the international communities and the United States have ignored them.\" Morales, who won a recall vote last summer by a two-thirds margin, also is eager for a vote. The referendum is as much about him as it is the constitution. \"It's a very important development,\" said Erasto Almeida, an analyst with the Eurasia Group, a political research and consulting firm. \"Morales came into office with an agenda of radical change. The new constitution is an important step to consolidate this agenda.\" Analysts and everyday Bolivians agree that the referendum is nearly certain to pass. DeShazo notes that more than 100 new laws will be required to put the constitution into play. That will take time. Almeida points out that Morales had to compromise on many issues \"as the result of a long and difficult negotiation.\" More than 100 of the 411 articles in the constitution Morales' party drafted in 2007 were changed as a result of negotiations with congress, DeShazo said. \"The fact that Morales made concessions and made the constitution more moderate makes the constitution more resilient,\" Almeida said. He sees a couple of ways in which the opposition might try to make trouble for Morales. \"He's going to get about two-thirds [of the vote]. That's what's expected,\" Almeida said. \"If he gets lower, you could have more tension because the opposition will be emboldened.\" If Morales gets significantly more of the vote than expected and tries to ram through his agenda, the opposition also could be energized, Almeida said. Toranzo, the La Paz investigator with the Ebert Foundation, has a more dire forecast. \"From Monday on,\" he said, \"Bolivians won't know what to respect: what was before or what will come. This will destabilize the country.\" He also thinks Bolivia's faltering economy may factor into Sunday's vote. The constitution was formulated, he said, \"during a time of fat cows, but it is being voted on during a time of skinny cows.\" Though spirited, the campaign has been relatively trouble-free. About 3.8 million Bolivians are eligible to cast ballots in the mandatory voting. Jennifer McCoy, director of the Americas Program at the Carter Center, is head of a nine-person group of observers sent by former President Carter, who frequently monitors elections. The Organization of American States has sent a 65-person delegation, and the European Union has 45 observers, she said. \"It's fairly quiet now. It's fairly calm,\" she said Friday. \"There were some protesters. There was a little bit of rock-throwing. But there has been no real violence, no deaths. There's more real calm than previous events in Bolivia.\" Hakim agrees, to a point. \"It's a drama that's playing itself out now,\" he said. \"The degree of polarization and friction does not leave me terribly optimistic. On the other hand, things haven't gotten out of hand.\" CNN's Gloria Carrasco in La Paz, Bolivia, contributed to this report."}

But visitors to the South Downs, drawn there for the unbroken vista of rolling hills and choppy seas, could soon be faced with the sight of scores of wind turbines towering above the waves. Energy Secretary Ed Davey has approved a £2billion project to build 175 turbines nine miles out to sea, each standing nearly 700 feet tall. Opponents, including the National Trust and the South Downs National Park, say the view from landmarks such as Beachy Head (above) and the Seven Sisters cliffs will be spoiled for ever . He insists the Rampion wind farm, set for completion in 2018, is essential because it will power 450,000 homes with green energy. Mr Davey, a Liberal Democrat, said: ‘This project is great news for Sussex, providing green jobs as well as driving business opportunities right across the country in a sector with a clear roadmap for long-term growth.’ But opponents, including the National Trust and the South Downs National Park, say the view from landmarks such as Beachy Head and the Seven Sisters cliffs, and towns including Brighton and Eastbourne, will be spoiled for ever. Depending on the terms of the contract that German developer E.on signs with the Government, it can be expected to receive up to £200million a year in subsidies, critics say. The National Trust, which owns sections of the Sussex coast, has formally objected to the project. In a letter to the Government’s planning inspectorate, the Trust said: ‘The beauty of the coastline matters to the nation. ‘The impact of the proposal on the designated assets of the National Park and heritage coast, on the landscape and seascape character of the area, on important visual receptors and on key National Trust sites is considered to be major.’ The decision was handled by Mr Davey and his energy department because it is considered a major infrastructure project, providing a large chunk of the nation’s electricity needs. Ed Davey and his Liberal Democrat colleagues are strong advocates of wind power, despite common objections from people who live near planned sites . Mr Davey and his Liberal Democrat colleagues are strong advocates of wind power, despite common objections from people who live near planned sites. The same cannot be said of certain members of his Coalition partners. A report published by the Campaign to Protect Rural England today reveals that Eric Pickles, the Conservative Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, has single-handedly slashed the number of on-shore wind farms and large solar arrays given planning permission in the last year. A year ago Mr Pickles announced he would personally oversee all wind and solar planning appeal cases. Since then the number of planning approvals for solar and wind farms has fallen from 80 per cent to 60 per cent. Mr Davey and Mr Pickles are known to disagree on their approach to renewable energy and the planning system - but at the moment each are confined by their own remit. The Energy Secretary has influence when a project is deemed to be a national infrastructure matter, while Mr Pickles can only intervene if an application is taken to appeal. In 2013, Eric Pickles announced he would personally oversee all wind and solar planning appeal cases. Nick Clack, senior energy campaigner at CPRE, said: ‘We applaud the Government for taking action to stop renewable energy projects that would have a damaging effect on the countryside. ‘But without a clearer and more strategic approach to planning in the first place, we’re relying on one minister to intervene and protect our landscapes. ‘Planning policy must be further clarified to make sure that the need for renewable energy does not automatically override environmental protection and the wishes of local communities. ‘The current approach to planning renewable projects, that are needed to produce low-carbon energy, is chaotic and unsustainable. ‘With the pressure for renewable energy in the countryside only set to increase, we need to see further improvements in planning policy and incentives for brownfield and commercial sites.’"}

The Facebook use in Affective Disorders study will analyse the changes in social media use by an individual before and during a bipolar relapse. If the first part of the trial proves that the Facebook monitoring helps to avert people from experiencing relapses then an application will be designed for users to download. People with bipolar can sign up to be part of a trial that monitors their behaviour patterns on Facebook to help prevent relapses . Users will have the option of an alert being sent to them, their doctor, a family member or friend if their social media pattern starts to suggest a possible relapse could occur. The Monash Alfred Psychiatry Research Centre (MAPrc) and School of Intelligent Systems at RMIT is being launched today by beyondblue chairman Jeff Kennett. MAPrc Professor Paul Fitzgerald said the idea for the trail came about when patients were observed to have a change in social media patterns around the time of deterioration in their condition. People with Bipolar disorder who use social media can show signs of their condition deteriorating when their posts and interaction become 'excessively social' . The excessive behaviour is often a telltale sign that the person could be entering a manic stage . ‘People with Bipolar disorder, particularly when they become manic, tend to become excessively socially engaged – the nature of the illness itself is very social, so that is a reason why we think Facebook usage is likely to increase above and beyond other forms of usage,’ he told the MailOnline. This information will becollected to see if it is possible to predict an episode of mania by analysing changes in Facebook use. Data on previous relapse episodes will be collected and compared to current data in order to have an accurate image of how Facebook use varies during a relapse episode. This information is collected to see if there is a link between how the person uses Facebook and their mood at the time of use.

{"prompt": "(CNN) -- Formula One's governing body is taking the unusual step of rewriting its own rulebook in the middle of the season in an attempt to end the tire crisis threatening to undermine the sport. The FIA has acted quickly by deciding to amend two rules which ban race drivers testing and prevent tires being changed during the season. The drivers and teams had called for urgent action after a series of dramatic tire blow-outs compromised driver safety at the British Grand Prix Sunday. Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton, who lost the race lead when his left-rear tire unravelled on lap eight, the Ferraris of Felipe Massa and Fernando Alonso, Toro Rosso's Jean-Eric Vergne, McLaren's Sergio Perez and Sauber's Esteban Gutierrez were all affected by tires failures. In response to the chaotic scenes at Silverstone, the FIA has proposed that race drivers take part in a tire development test at the British circuit on July 17-19. The test had originally been set aside for the teams to trial their young drivers, who are now set to miss out on a rare opportunity to drive an F1 car. \"Our priority is to ensure safety for all in Formula One and we believe the incidents at Silverstone represent a genuine safety concern for the drivers,\" said FIA President Jean Todt. \"We have thus taken the decision to alter the Young Driver Test in a bid to solve the problems we saw at the British Grand Prix. I believe it is fitting to carry out this work at the circuit upon which the issues were manifested.\" The FIA's World Motorsport Council now has to give the green light to the rule changes, but that is expected to be a formality. F1's sole tire supplier Pirelli is due to announce its response to the chaos at the British GP later on Tuesday. The Italian manufacturer said at Silverstone it had been looking forward to focusing on the racing after being reprimanded at an FIA hearing for organizing a three-day tire test with Mercedes in May -- but instead Pirelli has found itself once again the center of unwanted attention. Mercedes -- who were also reprimanded by the FIA for using race drivers Hamilton and Nico Rosberg and a 2013 car at the controversial Barcelona tire test -- have decided to sit out the Silverstone test for the sake of harmony within the sport. The German team's \"secret\" test still riles their rivals -- especially as they have since won races in Monaco and Britain -- but the shocking tire explosions at the British GP have underlined the need for Pirelli to find a legitimate solution to the tire failures. Pirelli had wanted to introduce a new tire construction at the Canadian Grand Prix in June but failed to get all the teams to agree to the plan at a meeting in Monaco. A spate of worryingly delaminations -- where the tire layers separate -- earlier in the season had led to concerns the tires were not safe. When Pirelli took over from Bridgestone as F1's official tire supplier in 2011, the rubber was deliberately designed to be less durable so that teams would do more pit stops and the racing would be more unpredictable. But subsequent changes to the construction of the 2013 tire, based on the same principles, have now provoked not just unpredictability but chaos on the track."}

For a man who held an international rally driving licence for six years, he should have known when to swerve. But Bevan has crashed this time. The ball has gone through the grille. From the 11 years he spent at the Professional Cricketers’ Association to his six at the helm of the League Managers Association, not many in either sport speak of his mistakes because there aren’t many. He is respected, he trumpets the causes most would agree with and, generally, has succeeded in modernising two organisations that needed it. Resignation: Cardiff said that Richard Bevan's position is now untenable and the LMA boss should resign . Texts: The LMA described Malky Mackay's messages to Iain Moody as ‘friendly text message banter’ His default position has been to support his members, which in the majority of cases in a trigger-happy sport has been the right course of action. But his organisation has taken a big risk in the case of Malky Mackay. Far from helping Mackay’s situation, the statement from Bevan’s organisation made it worse, if possible. The extent of Bevan’s involvement in the statement is not known. But the end product is way out of kilter with his background. He is a well-educated man, an astute politician of sport. He went to the prestigious Shrewsbury School, whose alumni include Lord Hutton and Michael Heseltine. His profiles variously point to him competing in three RAC Rallies, as well as windsurfing, playing football and cricket to a high amateur standard and golfing to a handicap of six. But in sports administration he has made his name. People in cricket talk of a tough, streetwise negotiator who shaped up the PCA. He was the statesmanlike figure guiding the England team in their decision to boycott a tour of Zimbabwe in 2003. His work to help former cricketers who fell on hard times should also be noted. He has made errors since taking over the LMA in 2008, but he has also spoken a lot of sense, questioning the consequences of transfer windows and calling for the FA to hold more power over the Premier League. Well-eductaed: Bevan, pictured with David Moyes, has made mistakes at the LMA but has also spoken sense . His work has been motivated by a desire to protect managers, who obviously need it at a time when only 16 of the 92 clubs have retained their boss since the 2011 calendar year. ‘Telling people, “It’s fine, get a mortgage” and the following week sacking them is something that they cannot do,’ Bevan said earlier this year. Sadly, what his organisation said about Mackay’s situation made far less sense."}

The former tight end, who is accused of shooting dead two men in 2012, smiled and looked relaxed in court as he chatted to his attorney before the hearing. His lawyers have asked Judge Jeffrey Locke to issue a gag order to prevent anyone involved in the case from commenting outside court. Scroll down for video . Relaxed: NFL star Aaron Hernandez smiles in court on Tuesday. A trial date of May 2015 has been set for the murder trial the former New England Patriots football player is facing . Victims: Safiro Furtado, left, and Daniel de Abreu, right, were shot dead in a drive-by shooting in 2012 . Attorney James Sultan said the defense was concerned that Hernandez would be unable to get a fair trial because of extensive coverage of his indictment in the double shooting of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado after a random encounter in a nightclub. Hernandez is also facing charges over the murder of semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd, who was shot dead in June last year. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges in both cases. 'I think it's incumbent upon all of us ... to do whatever we can to safeguard Mr Hernandez's constitutional right to a fair trial and a jury that has not been poisoned by unfairly prejudicial pretrial publicity,' Sultan said. He argued that a judge in Bristol County, where Hernandez is charged with killing Lloyd, had issued a gag order in that case. Smiling: Hernandez gestures with his hands, while they are still in handcuffs, as he waits for his hearing . The football player laughs and looks relaxed before the hearing to set his trial date for double murder . Prosecutors opposed the request. Assistant District Attorney Patrick Haggan called a gag order 'unreasonable' and 'unwarranted' and said it not the usual practice in Suffolk County. Haggan said Hernandez's lawyers were suggesting that 'because of his celebrity and his public figure status that Mr Hernandez should not be held to the rules of this court'. Haggan said prosecutors involved in the Hernandez case had not made any improper statements outside court. Sultan disagreed, saying that District Attorney Dan Conley had 'held a press conference' after the indictments against Hernandez were issued and again after he was arraigned. The judge took the request under advisement and did not indicate when he would rule. Locke made it clear that the May 28 trial date is only tentative. He acknowledged that the date could change because Hernandez's trial in Lloyd's killing is scheduled for October.

{"prompt": "By . Jonathan McEvoy . Sitting in the stands watching Jamaica’s ‘Sunshine Girls’ play netball on Wednesday was Usain Bolt. These Commonwealth Games needed an icon and it is this man, the superstar holder of six Olympic gold medals. He chewed gum, waved a Jamaica flag and talked with his little clique, including his attack-dog of an agent, Ricky Simms, and his friend from school, Nugent Walker Junior, known as NJ, his Man Friday. Bolt scurried off with his retinue after the match ended in a 50-42 loss to New Zealand, rushing past the reporters shouting one word: ‘Awesome.’ It was intended as his verdict on these Games, a sentiment he retweeted in full charm-offensive mode later in the day. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Usain Bolt turning on the charm at Commonwealth Games . Loving life: Usain Bolt waves a Jamaican flag during the 'Sunshine Girls' game at the SECC in Glasgow . The only problem is that a day before, while waiting for his car in rain outside the athletes’ village, he was seemingly more candid, giving the opposite view. He derided the Games as a ‘bit s***’ and said he was ‘not really’ having fun. Those words, taken down in contemporaneous notes, appeared in The Times on Wednesday morning. The story prompted Bolt to tweet: ‘I’m waking up to this nonsense… journalist please don’t create lies to make headlines.’ Mike Hooper, chief executive of the Commonwealth Games Federation, told the daily press briefing: ‘I think Usain’s tweet has said it all. I take his word that it is lies.’ That seemed a touch complacent, dismissing a reputable publication so readily in deference to the event’s leading man. Loyal supporter: Bolt, with his sunglasses on the back of his head, was on his feet to cheer on Jamaica's girls . Glasgow can't be that bad? Bolt plays the tourist as he takes a quick snap inside the SECC . All smiles: The six-time Olympic champions didn't look too bothered by how 's***' Glasgow might be . To try to elicit some sort of clarification, I walked up to the spare seat next to Bolt and introduced myself, reminding him that we had met briefly in Kingston, Jamaica, a couple of years ago. Before he had a chance to respond, security heavies manhandled me out of the way, one of them ripping my accreditation from around my neck. So much for the Friendly Games. This furore is extremely sensitive for the organisers because Bolt has a multi-million pound deal with Virgin Media, who are the ‘official presenting partner of athletics’. His image is plastered on Virgin billboards across the city, including on the main road to Hampden Park, where he is expected to run in the 4x100metres relay. On Glasgow Green, spectators have the chance to run against a hologram of Bolt, courtesy of… Virgin. The gangly Jamaican is the man in demand. So when he arrived on Saturday he was whisked straight to a press conference, where the fawning was on an industrial scale. The nadir was Roz Kelly, who works for Australian TV, saying she and her crew were there ‘as fans’ and wanted a selfie with him. Bolt has posed for pictures with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry, as well as with the mascot, Clyde. He is the one athlete with global reach. No wonder the organisers were so keen to take his side on Wednesday. However, this storm has not blown out. The journalist who broke the story, Katie Gibbons, is ready to confront Bolt about his denial. There is also outrage among Glaswegians, a few of whom proposed a campaign to get punters to turn their backs on Bolt in the stadium. Bolt is everywhere: The Jamaican sprinter is plastered on Virgin Media billboards across the city . Happy to please: Bolt poses with Clyde the mascot and children from Giffnock Athletics Club on Saturday . Incredulous: Bolt did not like it when a reporter questioned whether he would really run in Glasgow . Let's hear it for the girls: Bolt sends his best wishes to the team after their narrow Commonwealth defeat . A camera pointing the other way: Bolt gets some snaps of the Jamaican girls in action on Wednesday . I am not sure many, if any, will do that. The crowds here have been warm to competitors from all 71 nations. A cavorting, bow-and-arrow shooting Bolt up to his party tricks is unlikely to be a flop. One caveat: there remains some doubt about whether he will compete at all, especially if it is wet. He is overcoming injury and decided not to take part in the individual sprints. The cynics would say he is doing the bare minimum to honour his commitments to Virgin. Between massages on Wednesday, Bolt was training. However, for part of the relay handover session Kemar Bailey-Cole, the new Commonwealth 100m champion, was on the anchor leg that Bolt is supposedly due to run. The plot thickens. All smiles: Bolt jokes around in training despite the storm surrounding his comments about Glasgow . Are you lookin' at me? Bolt points at a photographer while wearing a camera round his neck in training . Speaking out: Kemar Bailey-Cole, who won 100m gold, has also criticised the Glasgow Games . If Bolt did criticise the Games, he would not be alone. Take Bailey-Cole, who said the food needed more seasoning and ‘wasn’t as good as London’. Jason Livermore, who was sixth in the 100m, was similarly underwhelmed, saying: ‘Usain’s somewhere in the village. I hope he’s having a better time than me. ‘The food? Oof. Back in Jamaica it’s not like this. I need to get me some clothes. It’s freezing.’ Actually, by Scottish standards, it has been positively balmy. It was 27 degrees at the triathlon last week. There is plenty to enjoy. The streets have a carnival feel. The competition is keen, some of it of outstanding quality. They have sold 1.2million tickets, a roaring trade. Delhi: An Indian health worker sprays insecticide outside the athletes' village a month before the2010 Games . They are night-and-day compared to Delhi’s chaotic staging of this jamboree four years ago, made memorable by dengue fever, collapsing buildings, stray dogs, spit-infested sinks and the chief medical officer going down with typhoid. Bolt missed those Games because they came too late in the year to fit in with his schedule. Take it from me, Mr Bolt, Glasgow 2014 is a doddle and a joy."}

Tory ministers have held meetings with Google an average of once a month since the General Election. The revelation of the extraordinarily close relationship increases concerns that the internet giant has the ear of the Government on a host of sensitive topics. Official records show that David Cameron has met Google executives three times and Chancellor George Osborne four times. Culture minister Ed Vaizey has met the firm no fewer than seven times while his Culture Secretary boss Jeremy Hunt – currently under pressure over his links to another media giant, News Corp – has held four meetings. The Tories' close relationship with Google goes back to David Cameron's first months as party leader. In 2006 and 2007, he spoke to the annual Google Zeitgeist conference (above) George Osborne has met Google executives four times; Culture minister Ed Vaizey (centre) has met them no fewer than seven times; and Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt - currently under pressure over his links to another media giant, News Corp - has held four meetings with the web giant . In total, there have been at least 23 meetings between Conservative ministers and Google since June 2010. The links are so strong that in recent years at least three senior figures have moved between the Tories  and Google. Links with media giants are a highly  sensitive topic for the Tories. The current section of the Leveson inquiry into Press standards is focusing on the painfully close ties between Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp and the Conservatives. Revelations have included the toe-curling text messages between the Prime Minister and the company’s former chief executive, Rebekah Brooks. In addition, a series of emails have lifted the lid on the close relationship between News Corp’s top lobbyist and Mr Hunt’s department during the company’s abortive attempt to take over satellite broadcaster BSkyB in 2011. Labour has also accused the Conservatives of going soft on online porn because of its close relationships with firms such as Google. Last month a Google executive caused outrage when she said it was the fault of parents if their children saw adult content online. The executive in question was Naomi Gummer, who until recently was Mr Hunt’s political adviser. Google was approached by the Tories to store patients’ records after the failure of Labour’s health IT scheme. And it has been repeatedly criticised for paying tax on less than a quarter of its UK income. In 2010 it generated £2.1billion here but locates its international operations in Ireland, where it can take advantage of the 12.5 per cent corporation tax rate. Along with many other media companies, Google is anxiously awaiting the Government’s long-delayed Green Paper for its proposed Communications Bill which will have major implications for digital media in the UK. Google has been repeatedly criticised for paying tax on less than a quarter of its UK income. In 2010 it generated £2.1bn here but locates its international operations in Ireland (above), where it can take advantage of the 12.5 per cent corporation tax rate . Last night Helen Goodman, Labour’s media spokesman, said: ‘Of course it is important for ministers to listen to business, but a meeting with Google every month does look like the sort of privileged access that small businesses can only dream of. ‘Ministers must disclose what they discussed. Did they challenge Google over their repellent tax avoidance, which was uncovered by the Daily Mail?’ The record of meetings, obtained from research into departmental websites, shows other Tory ministers to have met Google are further education minister John Hayes, universities minister David Willetts, policy minister Oliver Letwin and business minister Baroness Wilcox. Two Lib Dems – Business Secretary Vince Cable and Ed Davey, then an employment minister – have met the firm. The close relationship goes back to Mr Cameron’s first months as party leader. In 2006 and 2007, he spoke to the annual Google Zeitgeist conference. On the second occasion, Google picked up the bill for hotels and flights between London, San Francisco, Sacramento and Los Angeles. Last night a spokesman for Google said: ‘It’s absolutely right that governments speak with companies about issues that affect their citizens. Links with media giants are a highly sensitive topic for the Tories. Leveson Inquiry revelations have included the toe-curling text messages between the PM and News Corps' former chief executive, Rebekah Brooks (above) ‘The British Government makes the list of those meetings publicly available – including the Daily Mail’s 34 meetings over the same period.’ Last night a Tory source said the Government was working with internet firms to install higher-speed broadband, to crack down on online porn, and to draw up a major Green Paper on communications, and that it was wrong to say Google had any special access because of Mr Cameron’s relationship with Steve Hilton. A Conservative Party spokesman said: ‘All these meetings have been properly declared and it is normal for relevant ministers to meet with a company of this size.’ Steve Hilton and Rachel Whetstone have been linked to Mr Cameron since 1992 . First it was Murdoch, now Tories 'get too close to Google' The number of meetings between Tory ministers and Google executives raises questions because of David Cameron’s close relationship with his oldest political friend Steve Hilton and his wife Rachel Whetstone. Mr Hilton was until recently the Prime Minister’s most trusted adviser in Number 10, and Miss Whetstone is global head of communications at Google HQ in California. The three met in 1992 when they worked together on John Major’s successful election campaign. Mr Cameron then became a Whitehall special adviser, alongside Miss Whetstone, while Mr Hilton set up his own consultancy firm. The three became lynchpins of the ‘Notting Hill Set’. Mr Hilton even became godfather to David and Samantha Cameron’s late son Ivan, and the PM is godfather to the Hiltons’ second son. It was Steve Hilton who persuaded Mr Cameron to run for the Tory leadership in 2005 after Michael Howard – for whom Rachel Whetstone was by this time working as chief of staff – stepped down. Mr Howard’s resignation prompted Miss Whetstone to join the private sector, and she got a communications job at Google. Mr Cameron took on Mr Hilton, who had been working for advertising firm Saatchi & Saatchi, as chief strategic policy adviser, where he became known for his ‘blue sky thinking’ and came up with the idea of the Big Society. But questions soon grew over whether Mr Hilton’s wife’s position at Google was giving the internet giant too much influence on Conservative policy. Mr Cameron addressed the firm’s annual conference twice, in 2006 and 2007. Around this time he began to talk about encouraging patients to store their medical records with companies such as Google. The then Lib Dem health spokesman Norman Lamb, now a minister in the Coalition Government, said: ‘It leaves a nasty taste in the mouth that there are repeated references to Google, given the closeness of Team Cameron to that organisation, and it leaves concerns about commercial advantage.’ Mr Hilton moved with Team Cameron to Number 10 on the formation of the Coalition. Many of his policies were described as ‘bonkers’ by colleagues, and angered senior Lib Dems as well as civil servants. He wanted to slash protections for workers to help business, advocated ignoring EU laws and most recently called for the welfare budget to be slashed by a further £25billion. The arch-Thatcherite also wanted to sack two in three civil servants, and urged ministers to fly with ‘upstart’ Virgin rather than ‘fat cat’ British Airways. The shaven-headed son of Hungarian immigrants stood out in Number 10 as a result of his propensity to walk around shoeless and in a T-shirt, a get-up which caused Barack Obama to call him a ‘beach bum’. Mr Cameron and Mr Hilton spoke every Sunday and one insider said they were so close that he was the only person who could get the PM to change a policy within minutes. While Mr Hilton is an outsider in high society, Miss Whetstone had a privileged upbringing more akin to Mr Cameron’s. However, the relationship was not helped in the early 2000s by rumours of an affair with Viscount Astor, Samantha’s stepfather, before she got together with Mr Hilton. In March it was announced that Mr Hilton was to take up an academic post at Stanford University in California to be near his wife. He plans to return next year. Rachel Whetstone is not the only senior Tory official to have links to Google. Naomi Gummer, daughter of Mr Cameron’s Oxfordshire neighbour Lord Chadlington, worked with Miss Whetstone in Google’s public policy division and is still an executive there. She was previously an adviser to Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt. Amy Fisher, Caroline Spelman’s special adviser since last year, did a stint at Google as a press officer with Miss Whetstone."}
{"prompt": "A lawyer representing the father of Australia's top-rated tennis player Bernard Tomic says John Tomic was acting in self-defense when he headbutted his son's training partner Thomas Drouet on Saturday. On Monday, John Tomic, who is also his 20-year-old son's coach, denied a charge of assault in a Madrid court which ruled that a judge will decide his guilt or innocence at a hearing on May 14. The incident -- which resulted in a broken nose for the Monegasque Drouet -- took place on Saturday afternoon outside the hotel in the Spanish capital where players were staying for the Madrid Masters. Bernard was in town to contest the tournament only to suffer a first round at the hands of Radek Stepanek of the Czech Republic. \"I don't feel guilty. I did not do anything wrong,\" Tomic Senior told reporters of the fight. His lawyer Carmen Dieguez said the reason that Tomic Snr used his head, rather than his arms, to attack Drouet was because the tennis player, 29, was holding the coach's arms at the time. In a statement, Tennis Australia said they were awaiting further details before discussing the incident. \"Obviously media reports regarding a recent incident are very concerning,\" the country's governing tennis body said. \"We are working closely with ATP officials who are investigating the incident and are unable to comment further until the full facts are known.\" The incident continues the mixed career of Bernard Tomic, ranked 53rd in the world, and who was dropped from his Davis Cup side earlier in the year for what Australia captain Pat Rafter called a lack of professionalism. The youngster, who broke into the limelight when reaching the quarterfinals of Wimbledon as an 18-year-old, is no stranger to controversy involving his father, with the duo having been involved in several incidents. Croatian-born John, who moved with his family to Australia when Bernard was three, has been coaching his son since he was 13, even though a man who used to drive taxis for a living had no previous tennis experience. In 2009, John was forced to publicly apologize after telling his son to walk off court in the middle of a match against fellow Australian Marinko Matosevic in Perth as he was unhappy with the officiating. Despite the incident resulting in a one-month ban from the International Tennis Federation, John was up to old his tricks a year later -- railing at Australian Open tournament director Craig Tiley so vehemently about the scheduling of one of his son's matches that security was ultimately placed around the official. Last year, Tomic Junior was booed off court at Wimbledon, picking up a code violation after smashing his racket, as he made a first round exit before then requesting that his father should be ejected from the stands at the Miami Masters later in the year. \"I know he's my father but he's annoying me,\" Bernard, who was ranked as high as world no. 27 last year, stated to the match referee. Tomic Senior has often clashed with Tennis Australia, having previously threatened to switch his son's allegiance to Croatia unless his demands are met. Matters seemed to be improving as Bernard won his maiden ATP title in January but this latest incident appears to be yet another setback in a stop-start career for a player with a fine record at junior level."}

Leslie Sanchez says Republicans should treat Hispanics as part of the mainstream of America. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- As the members of the Republican National Committee prepare to choose a party chairman to serve for the next two years, the calls for new \"Hispanic outreach\" initiatives are flying -- in my view, unnecessarily. It is probably true that President Obama's election marks the beginning of a post-partisan, post-racial America, or at least a time when these issues are less divisive than in years past. But will the two political parties be as able to look beyond the stereotypes of Latinos and what the Latino experience is in this country, as they have for other ethnic and racial groups? As Republicans, we need to win at least 35 percent of the Hispanic vote to win the presidency. In 2008, John McCain got 31 percent, slightly exceeding the average for the past eight presidential elections. We've had our high points (George W. Bush 2004, 44 percent) and low points (Bob Dole 1996, 21 percent). Ten years ago, as an RNC press aide, I was given the responsibility for developing a team that would design a multimillion-dollar ad strategy to appeal to the nation's emerging Latino electorate. We conducted seminal research on Hispanic voting patterns that is still of value today. For example, we identified a \"GOP Upside\" of another 25 percent of Hispanics who were voting Democrat on the generic presidential ballot question but would be interested in voting for a Republican who offered a campaign agenda focused on family, education and job-creation issues. So it is mystifying to me to hear the ongoing references to the party's need to find \"a new way\" to speak to the nation's largest minority bloc. It's like being asked to reinvent the wheel. This isn't just a Republican problem. Democrats do this too, relating to Latinos as if we're primarily poor, immigrant or both. It doesn't work anymore, if it ever did. And although the anti-immigrant rhetoric spouted by Tom Tancredo and others was offensive to Hispanics and projected a \"We don't want you here\" image for the GOP, the fact is that it was offensive to a lot of other people, too. In the age of Obama, that kind of exclusive message is just not marketable. If Republicans truly want to develop a winning strategy for appealing to Hispanics, they need look no further than Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. They appealed to them not as Hispanics or immigrants but as Americans with an equal stake in the future of the country. What Hispanics want, and what we as Republicans want them to want, is to be included in the American experience. During the period in which Hispanics constituted a small minority of the overall nation, efforts like Richard Nixon's to ensure that they were counted in the national census were important because it meant inclusion. When people believe that they are already part of a community, such patently obvious efforts come across as patronizing. Hispanics, especially young professionals like me who were born and raised here in the United States, believe that we deserve more than a couple of high-profile meetings and a few Spanish-language ads. That was certainly true during the 2008 presidential campaign, which had little to interest Hispanics at all. McCain trumpeted his record as a champion of comprehensive immigration reform to Hispanics, while his campaign tried to make him more palatable to Republican conservatives by de-emphasizing his record as a champion of comprehensive immigration reform. McCain was hurt among Latinos by the perception that he caved in on immigration enforcement and abandoned his own bill. Obama's campaign message to Hispanics, though delivered largely in Spanish through his campaign Web site, was patronizing. In the summary of issues for his Latino Blueprint for Change, Obama talked about a narrow group of issues that, in my view, are important to only a small percentage of Latinos. For example, on education, his message focused largely on English as a second language and in-state tuition for undocumented students. On immigration, he tried to counter the Republicans. On jobs and the economy, he highlighted the minimum wage. These issues, which may have been important to a majority of Hispanics when Cesar Chavez was leading striking farm workers, are not at the top of the list for Hispanics today. To remain largely focused on them is to patronize millions of upwardly mobile Hispanics who are not immigrants and who don't think of themselves as hyphenated Americans. Which is probably why Obama's echoing of Chavez's \"Sí, Se Puede!\" during his concession speech after the Texas primary was met with silence and blank stares. Hispanic political sophistication is increasing alongside Hispanic economic progress. A new HispanTelligence Research report suggests that the number of Hispanic-owned businesses in the United States will increase to 4.3 million over the next six years. We need to appreciate that it is not the message as much as it is the audience. Speaking past Hispanics or down to Hispanics is not the way to invite them into a long-term relationship. We no longer see ourselves as hyphens or as members of the Hispanic community only; we see ourselves as Americans, with a broad array of interests. Before the development of the virtual world, communities were defined by geography, ethnicity, religion, income, race and other elements that were as apparent to those inside a community as outside it. Now, through social networking tools like Facebook and Twitter, which the Obama campaign exploited to new degrees of success, people are developing their own communities of common interest. Hispanics want to see the political parties realize that they do, in fact, belong to the larger community called \"America\" as well as myriad interest groups. We may choose to define ourselves as part of certain \"ethnic\" or \"interest\" groups. It's not the job of a political party to define us.

{"prompt": "Hong Kong (CNN) -- Tensions between Hong Kong residents and visitors from mainland China ratcheted up Wednesday, after a full-page advertisement decrying a so-called invasion of \"locusts\" from across the border appeared in a local newspaper. The advertisement in the Apple Daily asks if Hong Kongers approve of spending HK$1,000,000 (US$128,925) every 18 minutes to take care of children borne by mainland parents and declares that \"Hong Kong people have had enough!\" Picturing a giant locust perched atop a mountain overlooking Hong Kong, the ad invokes the locally-coined locust label used to describe mainlanders, reflecting a concern among some residents in Hong Kong that mainland Chinese are \"taking over\" the city. A surge in the number of pregnant Chinese women crossing into Hong Kong to give birth has put a growing burden on the resources of local hospitals. According to the Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department, the number of live births in Hong Kong by mainland mothers went from 26,838 in 2006 to 40,875 in 2010 -- a 52% increase. On Tuesday, Hong Kong Hospital Authority official said in a radio interview that public hospitals may ban mainland mothers to ensure that local pregnant women can be accommodated. This follows a decision last year by Hong Kong Secretary for Food and Health, York Chow, to cap the number of non-local women giving birth in the city in 2012 at 35,000. In addition to the perception of better medical services, many mainland women choose to give birth in Hong Kong so their children can gain the right of abode and other privileges conferred by a Hong Kong identity card. Of the 41.9 million visitors to Hong Kong in 2011, the majority -- more than 28 million -- hailed from mainland China, according to the Hong Kong Tourism Board. Wednesday's advert was organized by internet users, who raised more than US$12,000 within a week, according to the South China Morning Post. \"[Mainlanders] have already crossed our bottom line,\" organizer Yung Jhon, told the Post. \"Why are mainland mothers flooding in to take up resources in public hospitals, getting our benefits and social welfare? Why do mainlanders ... refuse to follow our rules and order? We can't accept that.\" The ad comes after a series of incidents in recent weeks that point to a growing resentment among locals, with some critics suggesting this is due to a deeper unease and anxiety over Beijing's degree of influence in local affairs and Hong Kong's autonomy within the \"one country, two systems\" that took effect after the city's handover to Beijing in 1997. \"The greatest fear Hong Kong people have is Hong Kong becoming just one more city in China,\" Chinese University of Hong Kong anthropologist Gordon Mathews told Time magazine last week. In December, a row between locals and mainland visitors on a city train was caught on video and widely circulated online. The prolonged yelling match, sparked when an local man became incensed by a woman who had disobeyed the no-eating rules and ended up spilling food on seats, led passengers to press the emergency button. Another incident occurred last month outside a Dolce & Gabbana store in Hong Kong when shop staff were accused of discriminating against locals by preventing them from taking pictures, while mainland tourists and other foreigners were reportedly allowed to do so. In China, reaction to the newspaper ad on micro-blogging site Sina Weibo ranged from indignation from sadness. \"If you are independent enough, then don't use resources from the mainland!\" wrote a user named lan-tong. @pqdexiaoxi pointed out that Hong Kongers have provided the mainland with flood disaster relief several times over the past decades. \"I believe many mainlanders are very grateful, but the advertisement hurts our feelings.\" @bingjilinjiezhi said: \"As parents, we all hope to find better living conditions for our children. Why should that be criticized?\""}

{"prompt": "By . Julie-anne Barnes . PUBLISHED: . 19:56 EST, 5 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:11 EST, 6 May 2013 . Risky treat: Lib Dem MP Jo Swinson had to be taken to hospital after allergic reaction . An MP had to be given life-saving treatment after eating a cake that contained nuts. Doctors had to intervene after Jo Swinson, 33, who has nut allergies, suffered a severe allergic reaction and began struggling to breathe. Miss Swinson, MP for East Dunbartonshire and a parliamentary aide to Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, suffered anaphylactic shock after attending the Colossal Cake sale, a Help for Heroes event at a Guide Hall in Bishopbriggs, near Glasgow. During the event on Saturday the politician, who has nut allergies, inadvertently ate a piece of cake that contained the ingredient. She began to feel unwell and took an antihistamine. However, around an hour later her condition worsened and she was taken to the Southern General Hospital. The MP was kept in overnight for observation and returned to work yesterday. Around one in 100,000 people in Britain have severe reactions to nuts and around 20 die annually. Foods such as peanuts, tree nuts  – including almonds, walnuts, cashews, and Brazil nuts – sesame, fish, shellfish, dairy products and eggs can all trigger a severe reaction, often referred to by the medical term anaphylaxis. Following her recovery Miss Swinson, who is Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Employment Relations, Consumer and Postal Affairs and a junior equalities minister, spoke of the frightening incident on Twitter. She said: ‘Thankfully now recovered from anaphylaxis episode yesterday: huge appreciation to the fab staff at Southern General for keeping me alive.’ Last night, a Lib Dem spokesman said the incident was ‘wholly accidental’. He added: ‘Miss Swinson spent the night in hospital as a precaution. She was back to work today as normal. She doesn’t like taking time off.’ Fellow politicians expressed their best . wishes. Tory health spokesman Jackson Carlaw tweeted: ‘All the best to . Jo Swinson following her near-death allergic reaction.’ Accident: Miss Swinson, MP for East Dunbartonshire, ate a piece of cake during a bake sale for Help for Heroes, unaware that it contained nuts . Anaphylaxis can affect the whole body, often within minutes of exposure to the substance that has caused the allergic reaction. Besides foods, wasp or bee stings, natural latex, penicillin or any other drug or injection can also trigger an attack. Symptoms typically include generalised flushing of the skin, a rash similar to that caused by nettle stings, a swelling of throat and mouth, and difficulty in swallowing or speaking. In the most severe cases, sufferers can collapse and fall into unconsciousness. Any allergic reaction occurs because the body’s immune system reacts inappropriately in response to the presence of a substance that it wrongly perceives as a threat. An anaphylactic reaction is caused by the sudden release of chemical substances, including histamine, from cells in the blood and tissues where they are stored. Hidden danger: Around one in 100,000 people in Britain have severe reactions to nuts and around 20 people die every year . This mechanism is so sensitive that minute quantities of the allergen can cause a reaction. The released chemicals act on blood vessels to cause the swelling in the mouth and anywhere on the skin. There is a fall in blood pressure and, in asthmatics, the effect is mainly on the lungs. Many people who know they have a serious allergy carry adrenaline auto-injectors. Adrenaline, also known as epinephrine, acts quickly to constrict blood vessels, relax smooth muscles in the lungs to improve breathing, stimulate the heartbeat and help to stop swelling around the face and lips. The Colossal Cake sale is an annual event run through Help For Heroes to raise funds for the country’s servicemen and women. Last year a total of 700 individual sales were held around the country to help the wounded. Scots TV star Lorraine Kelly is a patron of the charity. Speaking at the launch of the event, she said: ‘I am honoured to be a patron. It gives you a chance to say thank you and give something back. ‘It’s the fourth year of the Colossal Cake Sale and it’s just got bigger and better.’ Last year more than £100,000 was raised through the cake sales around the country."}
{"prompt": "(CNN) -- Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked militant group based in Somalia, claimed responsibility for the deadly attack at Kenyan mall in September 2013. Here is a Q and A that looks at this group: . What is Al-Shabaab and what are its aims? Al-Shabaab is a Somali group that was designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. government in March 2008. It is seeking to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state, according to the Council on Foreign Relations, which published a backgrounder on the group in July. The group is believed to be responsible for attacks in Somalia that have killed international aid workers, journalists, civilian leaders and African Union peacekeepers. It has struck abroad, too. It was responsible for the July 2010 suicide bombings in Kampala, Uganda, that killed more than 70 people, including a U.S. citizen, as they gathered to watch a World Cup final soccer match. How big is it? The total size of the group is not clear. A U.S. official who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the information said in 2011 that Al-Shabaab was estimated to control up to 1,000 fighters in the country. A U.N. report identifies one insurgent leader who is \"believed to command an estimated force of between 200 and 500 fighters,\" most of them Kenyans. And it has links to other groups. In February 2012, the group's leader, Ahmed Abdi aw-Mohamed, and al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri released a video announcing the alliance of the two organizations. Though Al-Shabaab's size may be in doubt, its potential for sowing terror is not. \"I would say that the greatest risks right now in East Africa are Al-Shabaab and the violent extremists that they represent,\" said Gen. Carter Ham in 2011, when he was commander of the U.S. Africa Command. CNN security analyst: Kenya, Westerners high on Al-Shabaab's list . Al-Shabaab's origins . Decades of weak government amid grinding poverty have long made Somalia a target for radical Islamist groups. Al-Shabaab's predecessor was al-Ittihad al-Islami (AIAI), which worked to create an Islamist emirate in Somalia. It was, in part, funded by former al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. AIAI, which the U.S. State Department designated as a terrorist organization, strengthened after the fall in 1991 of Siad Barre's military regime and amid the years of lawlessness that ensued. In 2003, a rift erupted between IAIA's old guard -- who were seeking to establish a new political front -- and its younger members (Al-Shabaab, which means \"the youth\"), who were seeking to establish fundamental Islamic rule. That led the latter to ally with a group of sharia courts -- the Islamic Courts Union (ICU) -- that was seeking to impose order over a landscape marked by feuding warlords in the capital city. Working together, the ICU and Al-Shabaab succeeded in 2006 in gaining control of Mogadishu. That sparked fears in neighboring Ethiopia that violence would spill over there, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Those fears -- combined with a request from Somalia's transitional government -- led Ethiopian forces to enter Somalia in December 2006 and to remove the ICU from power. That move proved to be a turning point, one that radicalized Al-Shabaab, which attacked Ethiopian forces and gained control of parts of central and southern Somalia, according to a 2011 case study by Rob Wise, who was then with the Counterterrorism Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. What is Al-Shabaab's relationship with Kenya? In 2011, the Kenyan government ordered a cross-border incursion intended to create a security buffer zone in southern Somalia after attacks on tourist destinations in northern Kenya that it blamed on Al-Shabaab. More recently, Ethiopian troops crossed the border and expelled Al-Shabaab from Baidoa, a strategic town midway between the Ethiopian border and Mogadishu. The group then targeted African Union soldiers and government buildings in the capital in suicide attacks. A suicide bombing in March 2012 killed five people at the Presidential Palace. Analysts say tension appears to have been growing within Al-Shabaab between Somalis and foreign fighters, several hundred of whom are thought to have entered Somalia in recent years to join the group. There may also have been disagreement within the group about the announcement in February 2012 of an alliance between Al-Shabaab and al Qaeda and about the group's ban on foreign aid organizations working in Somalia to save millions threatened by famine. Al-Shabaab breaks new ground with complex Nairobi attack . How and from where does it recruit? The organization has a sophisticated public relations arm that includes a Twitter account and video production abilities. \"Remember Mumbai?\" one tweet asked Saturday, as gunfire was erupting from Westgate mall in Nairobi. The comment was an apparent reference to the 2008 attack in which 10 Pakistani men associated with the terrorist group Lashkar-e-Tayyiba stormed several buildings in Mumbai, India, killing 164 people over a three-day period. \"Some youngsters resist death even when told not to be taken alive. It's going to be a long ordeal,\" Saturday's tweet said. Soon after, it announced it was responsible for Saturday's attack in Nairobi, Kenya. \"Alshabab confirms its behind the #Westgate spectacle,\" it said. A 2009 Al-Shabaab video is as slickly produced as a reality TV show, complete with a hip-hop jihad voice and a startling message. \"Mortar by mortar, shell by shell, only going to stop when I send them to hell,\" an unidentified voice raps on the video in American English. The video shows a man reported to have been Abu Mansoor al-Amriki, a U.S. citizen from Alabama. \"Away from your family, away from our friends, away from ice, candy bars, all those things is because we're waiting to meet the enemy,\" he says. But enemies -- and alliances -- can shift. Al-Amriki, whose real name is Omar Hammami, said last year in a video posted online that he had had a fallout with Al-Shabaab \"regarding matters of the sharia and matters of strategy\" and feared for his life. He was reported last week to have been killed in Somalia by Al-Shabaab. CNN is not able to confirm the report. Finding replacements may not be hard. Sheikh Ahmed Matan, a member of Britain's Somali community, said he knows of hundreds of young Somali men living in the West who returned to Somalia for terrorist training. How is it funded? The once ragtag Somalia-based al Qaeda affiliate has grown into an economic powerhouse, raising tens of millions of dollars in cash from schemes that have involved extortion, illegal taxation and other \"fees,\" according to the 2011 United Nations report. The United States believed then that the group was coordinating with al Qaeda groups in Yemen and might have been plotting attacks in the region and abroad. In 2011, it was generating \"between $70 million and $100 million per year, from duties and fees levied at airports and seaports, taxes on goods and services, taxes in kind on domestic produce, 'jihad contributions,' checkpoints and various forms of extortion justified in terms of religious obligation,\" according to the report from the U.N. Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea. How have Somalis been affected? Years of lawlessness and poverty have exacted a toll that Al-Shabaab has not helped. In 2011, the United Nations declared a famine in the southern Somalia regions of Bakool and Lower Shabelle, and Al-Shabaab reversed an earlier pledge to allow aid agencies to provide food in famine-stricken areas. That year, the U.N. Interagency Group for Child Mortality Estimation announced that Somalia had the highest mortality rate for children 4 and younger in the world. In May, a report jointly commissioned by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization and the USAID-funded Famine Early Warning Systems Network reported that 258,000 Somalis had died in the famine between October 2010 and April 2012 and that half of the victims were younger than five. What is the United States doing? The United States has supported U.N.-backed African forces fighting Al-Shabaab and strengthened its counterterrorism efforts against the group. It has also donated millions in aid. The U.S. State Department said this week that Somali security forces, aided by the African Union Mission in Somalia, have driven Al-Shabaab out of major cities and towns, creating \"a window of opportunity to fundamentally change Somalia's trajectory. What is the status of Somalia's government today? In September 2012, Somali parliament members selected Hassan Sheikh Mohamud as the new president in a vote that marked a milestone for the nation, which had not had a stable central government since Barre's overthrow 21 years before. That did not mean Al-Shabaab was calling it quits. In January, French forces attempted to rescue a French intelligence commando held hostage in Somalia by the group. The raid left the soldier dead, another soldier missing and 17 Islamist fighters dead. But there has been political progress there. In January, for the first time in more than two decades, the United States granted official recognition to the Somali government. Want to know more about Somalia? Get the fast facts .

The 15-year-old's owner had been feeding George roast ham, fresh prawns and entire roast chickens from supermarkets. Who's a big lad! Chubby George, from Liverpool, weighed as much as a King Charles spaniel and was at risk of developing diabetes after being fed an unhealthy diet of doughnuts and luxurious roasted meats.

She said: 'The weight was piling on him and when I noticed that his back legs were so thick I had to do something about it. 'He would eat anything that he wanted and he would be very spoilt. 'For instance, I would get him a roast chicken from the supermarket and he would eat that. 'So I took him to the vets and I was told that he almost had diabetes and if I didn't control his diet I would lose him.' Lazy: George, 15, weighed two stones would spend his heavier days lounging on the sofa. He ate a diet of roast chicken, fresh prawns and doughnuts, which was given to him by his owner Wendy Moulton . George was put on a special diet of dried food and water. He has now lost half of his body fat and weighs around 14lbs.

A probation officer could be in trouble with bosses after he failed to get permission to appear on a TV show - where he has sex in a box.

He could now face disciplinary action as he did not ask bosses’ permission to take part - and promotional material made it clear he worked as a probation officer.

Bosses at Greater Manchester Probation Trust will watch the show, being broadcast on Monday night, to see if it has an impact on the reputation of the probation service. In the show couples have 35 minutes to have sex in a large box on stage. They then discuss the act afterwards with presenter Mariella Frostrup and a panel of experts in front of a studio audience. The audience do not see the couples having sex in the box. Channel 4 has billed the show as ‘a sex talk show with a difference’. Channel 4 has defended the controversial new show, which airs on Monday and will feature three couples having sex in an opaque box before discussing the act with a studio panel. It forms part of the channel's Real Sex season. Channel 4's head of factual programming Ralph Lee told MailOnline: 'The idea of the box is that it will facilitate a conversation that's more immediate, more honest and more truthful than if we didn't have it. 'It's not about the technicalities of sex but more about discussing what it means to them as a couple. 'There has been a massive explosion of pornography but what there hasn't been is a conversation about real sex in people's lives today. 'This will add context to pornography.' Colleagues at the Probation Trust are also understood to feel the show is an embarrassment - as Mr Lashimba is seen as ‘the face’ of the probation service at Manchester Magistrates Court. When approached Mr Lashimba, 41, who lives in Manchester, declined to comment. But in promotional material his partner Ms Ellis, 39, insisted they are not exhibitionists, adding: 'Des was terrified he wouldn’t be able to do what was needed. But I wore some sexy underwear and that seemed to do the trick. 'We have sex as part of a normal, healthy and loving relationship. I hope people will look at the programme in a positive light.' Part of Channel 4’s Campaign for Real Sex season, Sex Box is described by the channel as ‘a panel discussion about the real sex lives of people’. Bosses at Greater Manchester Probation Trust say they have yet to see the programme and will review whether Mr Lashimba has breached employee guidelines after it is shown. A spokesman said: 'We did not know a GMPT employee was going to be appearing in the programme. As we have not seen the programme, we don’t yet know if it will have a reputational impact on either the Trust or on the employee, and we will review the situation after it has been televised.

{"prompt": "By . Victoria Woollaston . Flowers in bloom are one of the great joys of spring, but when viewed under a colour scanning electron microscope (SEM), they reveal an even greater surreal, alien-like beauty. From rose petals to arnica stigmas, and hibiscus stamens to pollen grains, a German photographer has captured the images with the help of a biologist from the German microscopy team at Eye of Science. The process of preparing the flowers to be photographed takes days of meticulous drying and coating in order to capture the beauty without the samples disintegrating. The images, including this shot of a rose petal, were taken by photographer Oliver Meckes and biologist Nicole Ottawa. The pair took the shots using a colour scanning electron microscope.  Roses are ancient symbols of love. It is national flower of England, as well as the provincial flower of Alberta, Canada. In the 15th century, Henry VII introduced the Tudor rose - a red rose for the House of Lancaster and a white rose for the House of York - after civil wars that became known as the War of the Roses . ‘Flowers are beautiful in \"normal'\" view, but when you look closer, some parts get very bizarre and unexpected structures appear - flowers within flowers, worlds within worlds,’ Meckes said. For a decade the pair, based in Reutlingen in the south of Germany, worked with an SEM they saved from the scrapheap, but for the last five years they have used a £250,000 FEI Quanta Series Field Emission SEM. The breathtaking shots show that these floral displays did not evolve to please our human senses, but instead serve the single purpose of attracting insects that will help pollinate the plant and allow it to reproduce. To prepare the specimens, Meckes and Ottawa took small pieces of each flower petal or leaf and put them through a dehydration process, before immersing them in 100 per cent alcohol. Meckes and Ottawa took small pieces of the flower petal or leaves and put them through a dehydration process, before immersing them in 100 per cent alcohol. This image shows the surface of a rapeseed flower petal that resembles the scaly skin of a lizard or snake. Rapeseed is a member of the same family as the mustard and cabbage family, Brassicaceae. Its oil was produced in the 19th century as lubricant for steam engines and, more recently, is used as diesel biofuel . The stigma of an arnica flower is pictured left, which reveals the top part of the female reproductive structure, known as the carpel. It resembles a spiky tongue. The anther of a flower of the small-leaved lime is pictured right. The anther is the part of the flower that collects the pollen from the stamen that produces it . Four lilac flower pollen grains pictured on a petal of the purple plant. The grains resemble a human brain and vary significantly to the bright red grains photgraphed on the coltsfoot, and the spiky grey grains of the arnica plant also captured by the Eye of Science microscopy team . Later, the alcohol was replaced with carbon dioxide in a pressure chamber to carry out what the team called the ‘critical-point’ step of the drying process. This meticulous method has been designed to maintain the appearance of the the sensitive and delicately thin surface of each plant - without which, the cells would collapse and the flowers would disintegrate. After being mounted on an aluminium platelet, each specimen was then coated in gold before being photographed. In one image, a close up shot of a rose petal resembles rows of raspberries, while the surface of a rapeseed flower looks like the scaly skin of a lizard or snake. This image shows pollen grains, shown in grey, on the yellow stigma of the arnica flower. Arnica is also known by the names Mountain Tobacco. The flowers  contain a toxin called helenalin, which can be poisonous if ingested in large amounts and has been known to cause gastroenteritis. Touching the plant can also cause skin irritation. Its name is believed to come from the Greek arna, which means lamb because of the plants soft, hairy leaves . This shot taken of a rapeseed leaf, with the light hitting the specimen from behind, makes it appear like a section of coral deep under the sea. After being submerged in alcohol, the liquid was replaced with carbon dioxide in a pressure chamber to carry out the final step of the drying process. This meticulous process has been designed to maintain the appearance of the sensitive and delicately thin surface of each plant - without which, the cells would collapse . After being mounted on an aluminium platelet, each specimen was then coated in gold before being photographed. The left-hand image shows the bright red pollen of the coltsfoot flower, and resembles cod roe. The hibiscus flower is renowned for its bright red and pink petal, but its stamens, pictured right, look almost dull in comparison. Tiny, spiky pollen grains are attached to the curved tips. The surface resembles the skin of an elephant . Another shot taken of a rapeseed leaf, with the light hitting the specimen from behind, makes it appear like a section of coral deep under the sea. In two of the images, Meckes and Ottawa capture pollen grains sat on the petals of arnica and lilac flowers. The arnica image resembles bacteria and its grey pollen grains look menacing with their sharp edges. By contrast, the pollen of the lilac is yellow and round and resembles the human brain. The stigma of the same arnica specimen in a separate image looks like a spiky tongue. Small yellow grains of pollen are scattered on the petal hairs of a marigold. The golden colour of the marigold gives the rubber gloves of the same colour its name. Potted marigold florets are edible and used to add colour to salads, or as a garnish. The flowers were used in ancient Greek, Roman, Middle Eastern and Indian cultures as a medicinal herb as well as a dye for fabrics, foods and cosmetics . The image on the left shows the floret of a chamomile flower, while the right-hand image is of a valerian flower which resembles the face of a bug. The Valerian root is often used to treat anxiety and sleeping disorders. It was used in ancient Greece and Rome,  and Hippocrates is thought to have been the first to link it to relieving insomnia. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia . By stark contrast, the pollen of the coltsfoot flower is shown as bright red, and resembles cod roe. The pair have previously used their SEM to take artistic images of bacteria, parasites, and butterflies to herbs, water bears, plant poisons and silverfish. ‘Working in the microscopic dimensions has completely changed our view of the world,’ Meckes said."}
{"prompt": "Washington (CNN) -- The question most readers will bring to George W. Bush's memoirs can be put into just two words: \"Why Iraq?\" Here's an abridgement of the former president's answer, from pages 228-229. \"There were state sponsors of terror. There were sworn enemies of America. There were hostile governments that threatened their neighbors. There were nations that violated international demands. There were dictators who repressed their people. And there were regimes that pursued WMD. Iraq combined all these threats. ... Before 9/11, Saddam was a problem America might have been able to manage. Through the lens of the post-9/11 world, my view changed. I had just witnessed the damage inflicted by nineteen fanatics armed with cutters. I could only imagine the destruction possible if an enemy dictator passed his WMD to terrorists.\" That's the key point: After 9/11, threats that previously glanced off all of our attentions suddenly rose to dominate our minds. Here's George W. Bush again, from pages 152-153, reporting on a discussion with Dick Cheney that occurred in October 2001 during a presidential visit to China. \" 'Mr. President ... one of the bio-detectors went off at the White House. They found traces of botulinum toxin. The chances are we've all been exposed.' The CIA had briefed me on botulinum toxin. It was one of the world's most poisonous substances. ... Deputy National Security Adviser Steve Hadley explained that the FBI was testing the suspicious substance on mice. The next twenty-four hours would be crucial. \"If the mice were still scurrying around, feet down, we'd be fine. But if the mice were on their back, feet up, we're goners. ... The next day, Condi got a message that Steve was trying to reach her. 'I guess this is the call,' she said. After a few minutes, Condi came back with the news. 'Feet down, not feet up,' she said. It was a false alarm.\" I was working in the White House in October 2001, and I remember vividly the mood of doom. Had you asked me then, I would have told you: I am certain I will die in the next two years. If it isn't botulinum toxin breathed into the air conditioning, then it will be a car bomb on 17th Street. If not a car bomb, then a sniper will open fire inside the Pennsylvania Avenue Starbucks where so many White House staffers picked up their morning caffe latte. I wrote a new will that October. I doubled my insurance coverage. My wife and I started uncorking and drinking the best bottles of wine in the cellar -- might as well enjoy them while we still could. President Bush nicely describes the way in which our post-9/11 fears became self-reinforcing. \"Years later, incidents like the botulinum scare can seem fanciful and far-fetched. It's easy to chuckle at the image of America's most senior officials praying for lab mice to stay upright. But at the time, the threats were urgent and real. Six mornings a week, George Tenet and the CIA briefed me on what they called the Threat Matrix, a summary of potential attacks on the homeland. \"On Sundays, I received a written intelligence briefing. Between 9/11 and mid-2003, the CIA reported to me on an average of 400 specific threats each month. The CIA tracked more than twenty separate alleged large-scale attack plots, ranging from possible chemical and biological operations in Europe to potential homeland attacks involved [sic] sleeper operatives. Some reports mentioned specific targets, including major landmarks, military bases, universities, and shopping malls. For months after 9/11, I would wake up in the middle of the night worried about what I had read.\" In retrospect, these CIA warnings look like a classic bureaucratic response: Chagrined by their failure to thwart the 9/11 attacks, America's intelligence agencies overcorrected. On September 9, 2001, a state trooper in Maryland pulled over one of the 9/11 hijackers for speeding. Ziad Samir Jarrah, one of the four men who seized the plane that crashed in Pennsylvania, was driving 95 mph in a 60 mph zone. Had Jarrah been detained, who knows how his fellow plotters would have reacted? Maybe they would have assumed their security had been breached and canceled the operation. But Jarrah's name did not appear on any watch list, much less any list shared with local law enforcement. Having missed Jarrah, the agencies became determined never again to miss anyone. They careened from providing a false negative to generating hundreds of false positives. Bush mentions that in late September 2001, FBI director Bob Mueller told him that there were 331 potential al Qaeda operatives inside the United States. The October anthrax attacks intensified the alarmist mood. In the days after October 2, 2001, anthrax-laced letters arrived at the National Enquirer; ABC, NBC and CBS News; and the Senate offices of Majority Leader Tom Daschle. Altogether, 17 people were infected. Five died. From the memoirs of George W. Bush, pages 157-158. \"One of the letters containing anthrax read: . 09-11-01 . YOU CAN NOT STOP US. WE HAVE THIS ANTHRAX. YOU DIE NOW. ARE YOU AFRAID? DEATH TO AMERICA. DEATH TO ISRAEL. ALLAH IS GREAT. I was struck by a sickening thought: Was this the second wave, a biological attack? ... The biggest question during the anthrax attack was where it was coming from. One of the best intelligence services in Europe said it suspected Iraq.\" And now the key line, on page 159: \"We believed more attacks were coming, but we didn't know when, where, or from whom. ... As time passed, some critics charged that we inflated the threat or manipulated alert levels for political benefit. They were flat wrong. We took the intelligence seriously ...\" iReporter: Welcome back, President Bush . Bush's account of his decision-making in his Iraq chapter will likely seem stunted to many readers. He offers considerable detail on the milestones toward the decision -- and yet readers will search in vain for the actual moment at which the decision occurred. On page 251, he \"wasn't ready to move yet.\" On page 252, \"I was deeply disappointed that diplomacy had failed.\" On page 253, \"Military action was my last resort. But I believed it was necessary.\" The how is all there. But a big part of the why is here: . \"I remembered the shattering pain of 9/11, a surprise attack for which we received no warning. This time we had a warning like a blaring siren.\" The U.S. had been accepting risks from Saddam Hussein for more than a decade. Suddenly those risks were now intolerable. And for all the grief and cost of Saddam's removal, that particular risk now threatens the United States no longer. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum."}

Ken Maguire, one of the passengers on . the boat, said about 10 minutes into the return trip on Monday, the boat stopped after apparently . hitting something. The Coast Guard determined that the propeller had become caught on a lobster trap, but initial attempts to cut it free were unsuccessful. They also attempted to transfer the passengers and crew to a separate ship, but that also failed, according to Coast Guard Petty Officer MyeongHi Clegg. Overnight, Coast Guard boats stayed near the vessel for security and passengers were provided with food, water, and blankets as temperatures dropped. On Tuesday morning, divers hired by the vessel's owner eventually succeeded in freeing the boat, Coast Guard Petty Officer MyeongHi Clegg told The Associated Press. 'They were able to untangle the line from the propeller,' said Clegg. Clegg said the Coast Guard was monitoring the safety of the passengers overnight and no serious medical problems were reported. The vessel will now be escorted back to shore by two Coast Guard cutters, but will be operating under only one propeller since the other was damaged in the incident, Clegg said. She expected the passengers would be very relieved that their ordeal was over. Whale watches are among the most popular tourist activities in the Boston area. Maguire said passengers were told they will get refunds and other assistance. The boat company hasn't returned a phone message seeking comment."}

Forecasters have also warned that strong winds and heavy rain could bring a weekend of wet weather misery to most parts of the country, triggered by the massive snowstorms in the US. The cold and wet weather has been sparked by a 'meandering' jet stream with winds of 200mph, which will allow freezing air from the Arctic to sweep across the UK. Scroll down for video . It was a foggy morning along the River Nene embankment in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire yesterday. More fog is expected as temperatures could drop to below -7C by next week . The Met Office said the distinct downward trend began last night, as recent mild temperatures were replaced with a cold snap which hit the north of England. The lowest recorded temperature was in Glascarnoch, Scotland, where temperatures dipped to a chilly -2C. Southern England managed to escape the bitter weather, with minimum temperatures in the south west remaining at around 10C. But, by Sunday night, most parts of the country will be in for a shock as temperatures again dip to around -3C, causing heavy frost on Monday morning. That cold spell will stick around for the beginning of next week, as forecasters warn temperatures in the Scottish Highlands could plummet to -7C. Simon Partridge from the Met Office said: 'There will be a far chance of frost around on Monday morning, mainly in central areas. 'It will come after a cold night on Sunday, when temperatures will be around -3C. 'But it will be nice and dry and still not far off average temperatures for this time of year. But, because of the mild weather we have been having, it will feel a lot colder.' Forecasters have warned that the snowstorms in the US, pictured is West Seneca in New York, could trigger strong winds and heavy rain across much of the country . Forecasters say the higher temperatures seen in the south last night will stick around today, with the mercury expected to reach a a balmy 15C in some parts.

Forecasters have warned it will be colder on Sunday night, with some frost and fog developing . It will then clear to make way for the colder weather, which could also bring a heavy dose of mist and fog.

Met Office forecaster Helen Chivers said: 'The jet stream will weaken as it moves into the Atlantic. 'When systems reach our shores, they will start to weaken due to high pressure over Russia. This three-day forecast shows how most parts of the country will be wet over the weekend, with the best chance of sunshine in the north of England and Scotland .

A high-ranking Royal Marine could be thrown out of the Armed Forces after he was convicted of voyeurism for spying on a schoolgirl with a mirror at a public swimming pool. Lieutenant Colonel Russell Paul, 53, watched the 11-year-old as she took off her bikini top after a swimming session last summer. But she looked down while changing into her clothes and saw the mirror poking out from underneath the next cubicle, Plymouth Crown Court heard. She and a friend ran to tell staff at the city's Life Centre leisure complex and CCTV footage showed Paul emerging from the neighbouring cubicle moments after the girl had fled. Paul told police he went swimming for 45 minutes, then showered and left, but cameras showed him in the water for just seven minutes. Officers searched his room at his base and found a bag containing 22 pairs of women's knickers, though Paul said they were a secret Santa present from seven years ago. They also examined his home computer and found Google search terms which revealed 'an interest in young girls, teen and pre-teen', the court was told. Llewellyn Sellick, prosecuting, said the girl spotted Paul spying on her on June 4 last year as she changed. He said: 'She saw an eye reflected in the mirror. She covered herself with a towel and left the cubicle.' Adrian Chaplin, defending, said Paul had a 'very good career' and wanted to 'apologise to the victims that his actions caused the upset that it did'. Sentencing Paul, . Recorder Simon Levene said the two young girls were left frightened by . their ordeal and would not forget it for a long time.

BU: Well mostly in song writing my experience is that there isn't so much inspiration as hard work. You sit there for hours, days and weeks with a guitar and piano until something good comes. But the urge to write is something you have to have. A conviction, an ambition to write and never stop until you think, \"This is the best I can do.\" Watch Bjorn Ulvaeus take CNN on a tour of Stockholm » . CNN: What drives you? BU: In my career the push has always been to take another step, to try something new. That means that after ABBA, when we split up in 1982, we were onto writing a musical [\"Chess\"] because we hadn't done that before. CNN: How do you feel about working in the theater? BU: Every time I sit in the audience and watch a show that I have been involved with, it is such an amazing feeling to see all those people around me, knowing they are actually watching and enjoying something I have written. That is such a feeling of pure joy that never goes away and that's why I guess I'm so attracted to work in the theater. CNN: How did \"Mamma Mia! The Movie\" come about? BU: When you have a big hit on the West End and on Broadway with a musical, as we had with \"Mamma Mia,\" there is always the question, \"when are you going to do the movie?\" Some people say you shouldn't do it until the actual stage musical is on its last legs, but I don't think that matters. We had been on Broadway for seven or eight years and eight or nine in the West End and we thought now is the time to make that movie. CNN: How has Stockholm changed over the years? BU: A city like Stockholm, being so dynamic and following trends, develops all the time. It's gradually changing but you can hardly see that. It is changing in a very healthy way that cities should change. CNN: How would you describe Stockholm in a few words? BU: Stockholm is unique in the world in that it's built on, I think, 14 islands. There are so many bridges and it doesn't have any high-rise buildings to speak of. It's quite spread out and open and airy with lots of parks. See photos of Bjorn Ulvaeus in Stockholm » . CNN: Let's talk about the cultural scene in Stockholm. BU: There is a very vibrant cultural scene in Stockholm. There are lots of places where there are concerts and there are loads of museums and theaters. There is everything really, and eventually there is going to be an ABBA museum as well. CNN: When will that happen? BU: I don't know -- I like to be arm's length when it comes to a museum about oneself. Other people should do that. CNN: That's quite a Swedish trait... BU: A lot of Swedes are quite modest and unassuming. I think that's actually the closest you can get to a national trait, if there is one. CNN: How does it feel that people from different generations are still enjoying ABBA songs? BU: In a way I'm kind of a bystander looking at this phenomenon that is ABBA, which is still around, and that I thought would be finished in 1981 and forgotten. I'm amazed how this could happen and I don't know why it happened. I'm just grateful and humble. I just sit back and enjoy. CNN: What would you like your legacy to be? BU: I would like for my children to feel that what I left behind was something that I did whole heartedly and with honesty, and something that was the best I could do and hopefully that they too can enjoy."}

{"prompt": "(CNN) -- Piracy is expected to pick up in the high seas off Somalia after a lull caused by monsoon season, maritime officials warned Monday. Suspected Somali pirates sit behind bars during the first hearing in their trial at Aden port court on July 15. The Combined Maritime Forces urged crews to take up safety measures, including using recognized transit corridors in the Gulf of Aden and reporting to the European Union's security center before transit. \"The prior preparation and vigilance of merchant mariners at all times of day and night is more important now than ever,\" said Rear Admiral Caner Bener of the Combined Task Force. International forces made up of more than 30 ships and aircraft from 16 nations will continue patrolling the waters to help fight pirates, according to officials. \"While our ability to deter and disrupt attacks has improved over time, we are constantly adapting the way we do our business as the pirates adapt and modify their tactics,\" Bener said. The waters off Somalia are rife with pirate activity, despite increased measures by military forces and shipping companies to ward off attacks. Heavily armed pirates have struck the busy Indian Ocean shipping lanes and the Gulf of Aden, which connects the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean. They have captured dozens of vessels and hundreds of hostages, making off with millions of dollars in ransom. It was unclear whether a ransom was paid. The Gulf of Aden, off northern Somalia, has the highest risk of piracy in the world."}
{"prompt": "By . Jim Norton . Diseased and dirty meat could end up on Britain's dinner plates as a result of new EU legislation, a union has warned. British food inspectors reject millions of carcasses carrying parasites and infections from the food chain every year. But Unison, which represents government meat inspectors and official vets, has claimed proposed changes to food legislation by Brussels will water down their ability to check the quality and throw out sub-standard meat. More than two million instances of tapeworm (pictured) were discovered in red meat by the Food Standards Agency between 2012 and 2014 . Larvae of parasitic roundworms, like those pictured, can cause milk spot in pigs . The changes come just a year after the horsemeat scandal, in which food advertised as beef was found to contain horse meat. Statistics collected by the Food Standards Agency between 2012 and 2014 recorded more than two million instances of tapeworm being discovered in red meat. Inspectors also rejected more than 560,000 cases of milk spot - caused by parasitic roundworm larvae - in pigs. During that period, they also rejected nearly three million chickens that had been contaminated with faeces during slaughter - which causes the most common form of human food poisoning in the UK. But the European Commission has argued it needs to shake up current food legislation. There are fears the new rules could see contaminated meat find its way onto British dinner tables . It is now reducing 70 pieces of detailed regulation into a more simplified framework that will 'reduce the burden on business' and 'improve consumer protection'. Rules on inspections of pig carcasses have already been changed. Officials have until now cut into pig heads to check that the animals were not carrying hidden disease and abscesses, but new regulations from June replace it with a visual inspection. Currently, all chicken carcasses are checked after slaughter by official inspectors or vets in factories, but the European Food Safety Authority has recommended this requirement be abolished. Unison has accused the UK government of lobbying Brussels for deregulation in order to reduce industry costs. Millions of carcasses carrying parasites  are rejected by British food inspectors every year . A spokesman for Unison told The Guardian: 'The UK government’s agenda will result in food that repulses us being dished up on our plates. 'Most people do not know that there are a small group of meat inspectors and vets that keep them safe from harmful and repulsive additions to our sausages, Sunday roasts and beef pies. 'They work in some of the most awful conditions in blood and animal discharges every day. They are always the first to come under attack, not only from the food business operators, but also from our government.' The Food Standards Agency has defended the proposals, arguing that factories would still have to produce meat that was fit for human consumption."}

{"prompt": "Rome (CNN) -- Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has survived political, corruption and sex scandals over the years, but on Friday, a Milan court sentenced the flamboyant politician to four years in prison for tax evasion. Berlusconi, who is likely to appeal, called it an \"unacceptable political sentence\" in an interview that aired on CNN affiliate TGCOM24. \"I was convinced that I would get acquitted of an accusation that is far from the truth,\" he said. \"This is a conviction I can easily define as political, incredible and even intolerable.\" He added: \"I'm a victim of judicial harassment.\" His trial, which also involved executives from Berlusconi's Mediaset television group and the head of a Swiss bank, concerned the purchase of TV rights for films that were then resold within the group at inflated prices. Prosecutors said the scheme, involving about 3,000 American films, allowed those involved to avoid a major tax bill. They may have to pay a fine of up to â‚¬10 million ($12.9 million) if the court's ruling is upheld. Under the Italian legal system, Berlusconi and his fellow defendants have the right to appeal their sentence twice, in the appeals court and a higher court. Also, because the case dates to July 2006, the statute of limitations will expire next year, meaning there is a good chance none of the defendants will serve any prison time. Berlusconi, 76, resigned as prime minister in November amid his country's debt crisis, bringing to an apparent end an 18-year era in which he dominated Italian politics. Through the years, he was accused of embezzlement, fraud and bribery, but he was never convicted until the tax evasion case. He also faces trial on charges that he hired an underage prostitute and later tried to pull strings to get her out of jail when she was accused of theft. The woman involved in the long-running case is the Moroccan dancer Karima el Mahroug, nicknamed \"Ruby the Heart-stealer.\" American movie star George Clooney had been expected to appear Friday as a defense witness in that case but did not show up. The actor's representative said he would not be serving as a witness for Berlusconi. CNN's Hada Messia contributed to this report."}
{"prompt": "Bashar Al-Assad launched the chemical attack which killed hundreds of people because he 'lost his nerve' in a moment of panic and worried that Damascus would fall to rebel troops, according to new intelligence. In a telephone call which was tapped by German spy chiefs, a senior Hezbollah commander told the Iranian embassy in Lebanon that Syria's president intended to tilt the balance of power towards the regime in the battle for control of the country's capital. However, it appears that the chemical attack backfired, as it looks set to prompt a major intervention from American and French troops aimed at crippling Assad's military capabilities. Barack Obama today spoke out to demand that the world take action against Syria, saying that the international community 'cannot be silent' over the use of chemical weapons. Scroll down for video . Attack: Bashar Al-Assad is said to have launched a barrage of chemical weapons after he 'lost his nerve' Promise: Barack Obama said that the 'credibility' of the West was in question if it did not intervene . The German intelligence came as Vladimir Putin warned the West not to take unilateral action against Syria, and repeated his claim that the regime was not responsible for the chemical weapons strike in the suburbs of Damascus two weeks ago. Russia today announced that it is sending a missile cruiser to the eastern Mediterranean to enforce the country's interests in the volatile region. Pope Francis also entered the fray, attempting to slow the march to war by summoning ambassadors from all over the world. The call from a Hezbollah leader about the chemical attack, in which he described the move as 'a big mistake', was intercepted by Germany's BNC intelligence service and reported by Der Spiegel magazine. The revelation has led the country's top spies to agree with the U.S. intelligence assessment that Assad was indeed responsible for using chemical weapons in the attack on August 21. BND president Gerhard Schindler said that following a 'thorough analysis', the regime must have been the perpetrator, and the government is the only actor which possesses chemical agents such as sarin. Vote: Mr Obama, pictured with Sweden's prime minister Fredrik Reinfeldt, is facing a debate in Congress . Meeting: Mr Obama with his national security team at a breakfast summit with Swedish officials . The BND believes that the use of . sarin may have been meant as a deterrent against rebel forces, but that . the military used too much of it by mistake. 'The . new information from the BND could become important in the coming . days,' Der Spiegel said. 'Thus far the U.S. has only noted that after . the attack, intelligence agencies had intercepted internal government . communications indicating concern about a possible UN inspection of the . site. 'The telephone . conversation intercepted by the BND could be an important piece in the . puzzle currently being assembled by Western intelligence experts.' Despite . the findings, Germany is unlikely to join any military action by the . West after both Angela Merkel and her main election rival ruled out an . attack.

War: Children stand around in the rubble of a building apparently destroyed by Assad's forces . Strike: The West is expected to launch military attacks on Syria within the next few days . By contrast, Mr Obama is expected to win the support of the U.S. Congress after leading figures from both the Democratic and Republican parties came out in support of intervention. Speaking in Stockholm as he travelled to the G20 summit in St Petersburg, Mr Obama insisted that it was essential to strike against Assad over the chemical attacks. 'In the face of such barbarism the international community cannot be silent,' he said at a press conference. 'Failing to respond to this attack would only increase the risk of more attacks and that possibility that other countries would use these weapons, as well.' The President defended his decision to intervene once Assad crossed the 'red line' of using chemical weapons, saying that it was vital to uphold 'international norms'. Defiant: Vladimir Putin has warned the West against intervening in Syria and igniting a regional conflagration . 'That wasn't something I made up,' he said. 'I didn't pluck it out of thin air. There's a reason for it. 'The . international community's credibility is on the line. America and . Congress' credibility is on the line, because we give lip service to the . notion that these international norms are important.' He also suggested that Putin might be persuaded to change his mind on supporting Assad's government. 'I'm . always hopeful, and I will continue to engage him,' Mr Obama said. 'Ultimately, we can end deaths much more rapidly if Russia takes a . different approach to these problems.' Speaking . alongside Swedish prime minister Fredrik Reinfeldt, he concluded: 'The . moral thing to do is not to stand by and do nothing.' Summit: World leader will soon be meeting at the Constantine Palace in St Petersburg, pictured . Banquet: The leaders will dine tomorrow at the Grand Palace Peterhof State Museum . The French parliament is today set to debate a possible military response, although the vote is considered much less important than in Britain or the U.S. because of president Francois Hollande's large majority and relative freedom of action. 'If you want a political solution you have to move the situation,' foreign minister Lauren Fabius said this morning. 'If there's no sanction, Bashar Assad will say, \"That's fine, I'll continue what I'm doing.\"' Adding to the tension in the eastern Mediterranean, where Israel and the U.S. test-fired a missile yesterday, Russia today ordered a missile cruiser to take over its operations in the region. The ship, named Moskva, will be joined by a destroyer from Russia's Baltic Fleet and a frigate from the Black Sea Fleet. 'The Cruiser Moskva is heading to the Gibraltar Straits,' a military source told the state news agency. 'In approximately 10 days it will enter the east Mediterranean, where it will take over as the flagship of the naval task force.' Russia is Assad's most powerful global ally, and has consistently opposed Western intervention in Syria's long-running civil war, calling instead for negotiations to reach a diplomatic solution. Attack: A boy who survived the chemical attack on the eastern suburbs of Damascus two weeks ago . Mr Putin suggested in an interview yesterday that Russia would support a UN resolution on military strikes if Assad is proven to have carried out the chemical attack. However, he insisted that it would have been 'ludicrous' for the regime to draw the opposition of the international community by using banned substances such as sarin. 'From our viewpoint, it seems absolutely absurd that the armed forces, which are on the offensive today and in some areas have encircled the so-called rebels and are finishing them off, that in these conditions they would start using forbidden chemical weapons while realising quite well that it could serve as a pretext for applying sanctions against them,' he said. 'If there are data that the chemical weapons have been used, and used specifically by the regular army, this evidence should be submitted to the UN Security Council. 'And it ought to be convincing. It shouldn't be based on some rumours and information obtained by special services through some kind of eavesdropping, some conversations and things like that.' Votes: Presidents Barack Obama and Francois Hollande have both submitted to lawmakers' debates on Syria . The Russian president said he was sorry that Mr Obama had cancelled a one-on-one meeting which was due to precede the G20 summit. 'President Obama hasn't been elected by the American people in order to be pleasant to Russia,' he said. 'And your humble servant hasn't been elected by the people of Russia to be pleasant to someone either. 'We work, we argue about some issues. We are human. Sometimes one of us gets vexed. But I would like to repeat once again that global mutual interests form a good basis for finding a joint solution to our problems.' One country which is likely to support any Western action is Turkey, one of the leading regional powers, whose prime minister said today that he would join an international coalition designed at reining in Assad. Authorities at the Vatican, which has been outspoken about attempting to avoid war in Syria, have asked all ambassadors in the city-state to attend an audience with the Secretary of State tomorrow. It is the first time that the whole diplomatic corps has been summoned since 2003, when John Paul II attempted to prevent the invasion of Iraq. Vatican spokesman Padre Federico Lombardi said the Secretariat of State would put the Pope's position on Syria clearly. The summons was 'a very infrequent and significant even', he added. Francis has already announced a day of peace for Syria on Saturday, 'the meanings and purpose' of which will be explained at the conference of ambassadors, the official Vatican newspaper the Osservatore Romano explained. In an impassioned plea for peace during his Angelus prayer on Sunday Francis said his heart was 'deeply wounded by what is happening in Syria and anguished by the dramatic developments which are looming'. Syria's civil war has been raging for two and a half years, since Assad started cracking down on protests inspired by the revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt, and has killed more than 100,000 people. It was revealed this week that more than 2million Syrians had been forced out of their homeland by the fighting, with the vast majority ending up in Lebanon, Turkey or Jordan."}

Former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney, pictured here in Washington, D.C. in May, said Sunday that Obama is a 'failure as a president.' Cheney, left, the former vice president under George W. Bush, center, said that the Obama administration can no longer blame his former boss for all their woes. Bush and Cheney are pictured here with former Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert on the House floor during the State of the Union address in 2006 . Cheney, who has returned to his Wyoming roots since serving as vice president under George W. Bush, told the radio station that Washington is 'a mess' these days he's glad he no longer has to live there. 'I think the scandals, with respect to the Veterans Administration, with respect to the IRS, these are bad situations,' he said, according to Business Insider. 'Even worse,' Cheney said, is the current administration's 'absolute gutting' of the military. 'The army is being cut by this administration back to a level that is lower than what we had at the time of Pearl Harbor in 1941.' Cheney, a former Department of Defense Secretary under President H.W. Bush, said he'd learned that the army was about to get rid of 500 majors and it recently laid off a 'large group' of captains. 'They're dramatically cutting back the defense budget, year after year . after year,' he opined. While Cheney said he thinks Obama is out of line for scapegoating his predecessor, the former Bush administration official forewarned Obama that future presidents would be justified in reprobating him over the dilapidation of the U.S. military. 'I think it's a terrible mistake. I think we'll pay a terrible price for . it down the road when his successors are faced with world crises and . we don't have the kind of military that will let us guarantee that we . can get a favorable outcome,' Cheney said of the cuts in audio of the interview provided by Mediate. Noting that it takes years to train members of the nation's armed forces, Cheney argued that a draw down of forces would 'cripple us in future years.' Cheney levied similar criticisms at Obama during a meeting of Republican Party officials on Thursday evening, Time reports. 'We need the world’s strongest military,' Cheney reportedly said. 'It’s as important now as it’s ever been. 'President Obama is making an enormous impact on some President 15 or 20 years from now when he has to respond to some crisis. 'I can guarantee you no future secretary of defense will call Barack Obama and thank him for what he did,' Cheney added.

The overall design of the phone is shown, cast in shadows, and the handset curves from top to bottom - unlike Samsung's Galaxy Round that curves from left to right. Technology site Engadget discovered the images, pictured, which appear to show LG's G Flex device with a 6-inch screen. It curves from top to bottom - unlike Samsung's Galaxy Round that curves from left to right . There's been a bit of a merry-go-round between the two Korean phone makers in recent months; as soon as one announces an advancement in flexible technology, the other follows suit shortly after. The two firms were the first in the world to sell curved OLED TV screens, for example. Samsung announced earlier this year it was working on flexible smartphone technology before LG claimed it had completed work on its own flexible 6-inch plastic screen at the start of last week. Just a day later, Samsung unveiled its Galaxy Round handset in Korea. Samsung claimed its Galaxy Round . handset was curved on the horizontal because this makes it easier to . hold in the palm of a hand. However, LG's G Flex appears to curve on the . vertical which goes against Samsung's claims - so what is the point of . the technology? Following the Galaxy Round announcement last week, Android expert Kellex from Droid Life said: 'This is a Galaxy Note 3 with a curved display and a couple of extra gimmicky . features. We still aren’t seeing a point.' Dave Evans, Chief Technology Officer at Somo said: 'Some might be calling this a gimmick, but we think this is an interim . step toward ‘truly’ flexible screens that would revolutionise the . current form factors of mobile. 'Some people thought touchscreen phones . were a gimmick and would never catch on. Seven years later I think it’s . fair to say those people have been proved wrong.' Stephen Ebbett, global director of gadget insurer Protect Your Bubble, similarly disagrees and told MailOnline: 'While flexible screens haven't been lauded as an aesthetic marvel, they're no design gimmick. 'Almost . a third of mobile claims we process are for accidental damage - mainly . cracked screens from people dropping or sitting on them. If unbreakable, . bendable screens gain popularity, it would solve that problem . overnight.' Will Findlater, Global online editor for Stuff Magazine . added: 'Looking further on, the roll-up tablet would have obvious . benefits for portability - it could be like carrying a real newspaper . instead of a solid rectangle all over again - and there could be new, . intuitive user interfaces introduced, as we've already seen with Plastic . Logic's Papertab and its ability to swap between pages when its corners . are bent slightly upwards. 'There's even talk of gadgets that can adapt their physical dimensions based on what you're using them for.' David Quin, Head of Consumer Applications at CoPilot told MailOnline: 'There’s hint of ‘we’ve launched it because we can’ about some of the new curved smartphones announced recently, however it’s really just the beginning. In the near future screens will become thinner and won’t need to be flat like they are today, making them better suited for certain tasks. A curved screen could help reduce glare in direct sunlight for example. 'Designers will be able to embed technology in a more subtle, natural way: both more attractive and comfortable to use - think of a curved sat nav display embedded seamlessly within the sweep of your car’s dashboard or a status display on fridge fascia. 'There’s great possibilities for wearable technology too of course, for example curved smart watches or a tablet computer that can roll-up and even fold into your pocket. 'The challenge will be to introduce flexible technology in way that’s actually useful to people, not simply as a marketing gimmick.' Rob Hodges at e2save continued: 'Provided the Galaxy Round proves to be robust in South Korea, we could see round displays roll out on more smartphones and wearable tech over the next 2-3 years.' Paul Briden, Reviews Editor from Know Your Mobile told MailOnline: 'Phones with curved glass displays have been released before. That particular model sold well, but it wasn’t because it had a curved display it was because it was an all-round good phone with Google’s official stamp on it and one of the few at the time running stock Android. 'The difference this time is this new technology, the flexible OLED component, which is specifically the substrate underneath the glass and which actually produces the picture you see. 'The technology is significant because it is unbreakable, unlike the older glass substrate, and in the future the flexible nature potentially allows for more inventive phone designs with things like wrap-around displays. 'It’s worth pointing out though that there’s still a layer of glass on top, which is still breakable, so for users worried about cracking their screen the change isn’t quite as significant just yet, though this is likely to change in the future.' The Galaxy Round curves from left to right and is only currently available in the company's home region. LG . is set to launch its own curved phone next month - although some . experts claim it won't be ready until the start of next year. LG's 6-inch display is made of bendy plastic substrates, rather than . glass, and the panel can be attached to any curved device. Samsung's Galaxy Round handset, pictured, curves from left to right. The company claims this makes it more comfortable to hold than other phones . This image shows the alleged LG G Flex phone from a side angle. It appears to curve from top to bottom, unlike Samsung's Galaxy Round, but it is thinner than its rival's device . The design is 0.44mm thick and has a protective film attached to the back, making it 'bendable and unbreakable.' It is vertically concave from top to bottom, has a radius of 7cm and weighs 7.2g. LG . Chem, the South Koren firm's research arm, additionally said it was ready to unveil a curved battery prototype ahead of any new handset launch. LG Display's technology could also be fitted to smart watches, and other devices, that can be wrapped around items, pictured . Although the handset isn't expected . to be bendy, the use of a flexible screen could mean it has a more . curved display than current phones. Samsung's . Nexus S and Galaxy Nexus phones have slightly curved, OLED screens, but . they both use curved glass, not flexible plastic. LG Display claims the flexible OLED panel is the 'world's slimmest among . existing mobile device panels.' The company's new battery technology could also revolutionise smartphones because it is so bendy it can be tied in knots. It . could even improve the battery life of phones because manufacturers . could add more power into the batteries, if they're not restricted by . size or shape. LG Chem's cable-type lithium-ion battery can even woven into textiles. This means the technology could also be fitted to clothes, and users could end up 'wearing' phone chargers."}

The bracelet was made to celebrate the life of Michael Otten, an FDNY firefighter who died on 9/11. His widow Marion Otten, of East Islip, gave it to her son Jonathan, but he ended up losing ot 10 years ago. Found! The bracelet honoring fallen 9/11 firefighter Michael Otten was found 10 years after it was lost . Recovered: It was found by Marlene Quinn, who was mourning the death her brother, a volunteer firefighter . Treasured possession: Marion Otten said her son, Jonathan Otten (seen here on the right)  now keeps the bracelet bearing his father's name on his bedroom dresser . It was when Marlene Quinn was out walking on Robert Moses Beach when she found the treasured possession. 'I was walking along and a wave came up. It went away and that bracelet was there,' she said. The bracelet bore Michael Otten's name, and she instantly recognized the name as a local firefighter. 'Michael J. Otten,' the inscription read. 'F.D.N.Y. LADDER 35 9/11/01.' In memorium: The bracelet was made in memory of Michael Otten, an FDNY firefighter who died on 9/11 . Marlene Quinn put the bracelet in the mail, along with a note . When the bracelet arrived, Otten's widow, Marion, didn't even know it was missing, she said . The item also had special significance for her because her own brother, Michael O'Neill, who was also a firefighter, had just died unexpectedly in the spring. 'I clutched it and held on to it for the longest time,' said Mrs Quinn said to NBC News. She tracked down the Otten family address and learned even more remarkable coincidences. Not only were the late Mr Otten and her brother both firefighters, they both lived in East Islip and at one time, lived just a block apart. Her brother also attended grade school directly across the street from Otten's family home, Mrs Quinn learned. She sent the bracelet back to the Ottens with a handwritten note. The two women met up on Friday, convinced the bracelet discovery was fate . 'Why now? Why did it wash up now?' Otten said to Quinn. 'You needed it. We needed it.' 'I knew they needed it and I thought it was my brother coming through,' Quinn said. 'There is another firefighter in heaven.' Marion Otten initially felt shocked, and then overwhelmed, she said, 'because people still remember, think about it.' When the bracelet arrived, Otten's widow, Marion, didn't even know it was missing, she said. Her son Jonathan had worn it in honor of his father. He lost it on the beach nearly a decade ago, when he was 11 or so. 'It was just a bracelet to me back then,' he said. 'It didn't have such a big meaning as it does now.' 'Things happen for a reason,' Marion Otten says. 'I see it as a sign.' 'There are no coincidences,' said Otten. 'There's a reason why it happened. It brings us together for whatever reason' \"We have a connection, I feel,\" said Marion Otten, who will visit her late husband's firehouse on the 9/11 anniversary on Thursday . Jonathan Otten now keeps the bracelet on his bedroom dresser. He's afraid to lose it again, she said. 'It's another tie to his dad and the department,' Marion Otten said. The two women have since met up to discuss their loving families and those that they lost. 'To think all the poor souls we did lose on 9/11, it's someone from my hometown,' said Quinn. 'Why now? Why did it wash up now?' Otten said to Quinn. 'You needed it. We needed it.' 'There are no coincidences,' said Otten. 'There's a reason why it happened. It brings us together for whatever reason.'"}

Alzheimer's could one day be diagnosed by a simple eye test . Alzheimer's could one day be diagnosed by a simple eye test. The disease is thought to kill cells in the eyes at the same time as it kills cells in the brain. This means it may be possible to spot dementia via an easy and inexpensive test at an optician’s. Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia affect more than 800,000 Britons and the number is expected to double in a generation as the population ages. Techniques used in diagnosis, including memory tests and brain scans, are far from perfect and definitive proof only comes on examining the brain after death. Simplifying and speeding up diagnosis could mean that many more people get the help they need. US researchers capitalised on the fact that the retina, the light-sensitive ‘film’ at the back of the eye, is a direct extension of the brain. It is also the only part of the brain that is readily accessible. In tests on mice, layers of the retina were up to 49 per cent thinner in animals genetically-engineered to develop Alzheimer’s, compared with healthy creatures of the same age. Researcher Scott Turner, of Georgetown University in Washington DC, said: ‘The retina is an extension of the brain, so it makes sense to see if the same pathologic processes found in an Alzheimer’s brain are also found in the eye.’ It is thought that when brain cells die in Alzheimer’s, leading to shrinking of the organ, they also die in the eye, leading to thinning of the retina. Dr Turner told the Society for Neuroscience’s annual conference in San Diego, California, that the research is still at an early stage and he still has to prove that the same thing happens in people. If it does, it may be possible to use equipment already used to detect other eye conditions to spot Alzheimer’s. Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia affect more than 800,000 Britons and the number is expected to double in a generation as the population ages. Image shows CT scans of a brain with Alzheimer's . The eye scan could also be given to track how well a drug is working – or even to predict who is going to develop the disease in years to come. Dr Turner said: ‘Changes in the brain are found ten to 20 years before the onset of dementia. Retinal thinning may similarly predict impending Alzheimer’s disease but this is speculation so far.’ Those given early warning could change their diet or do more exercise in an attempt to keep their brain healthy for as long as possible. Dr Laura Phipps, of Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: ‘There is increasing evidence linking a loss of retinal cells to Alzheimer’s disease, and it’s positive to see this line of research being followed up. ‘This early-stage study, which is yet to be published in full, was carried out in mice, and further research will be necessary to determine whether changes in the retina found here are also found in people with Alzheimer’s. ‘Diagnosing Alzheimer’s with accuracy . can be a difficult task, which is why it’s vital to continue investing . in research to improve diagnosis methods.’ In tests on mice, layers of the retina were up to 49 per cent thinner in animals genetically engineered to develop Alzheimer's, compared to healthy creatures of the same age . Dr Clare Walton, of the Alzheimer’s Society, said: ‘It would be great if we could simply look into someone’s eyes to see if they had Alzheimer’s but unfortunately spotting the disease is a lot more complicated than that. ‘This study builds on existing evidence linking the loss of cells in the eyes to dementia but, whilst a link could provide a useful and non-invasive aid to diagnosis, it’s important to stress that this study looked at mice and therefore the results may not be the same in people. ‘Much more research needed in humans so that we can spot Alzheimer’s early and stop the disease in its tracks.’"}

Rod Laver, watching what he describes as ‘a completely different sport’ to the one he once played with distinction, believes that Novak Djokovic remains the favourite for the title this year. 'I saw a lot of his match against Tsonga on Monday, he is just so tough and consistent off the ground,' says the 75-year-old Australian legend. No 1: Novak Djokovic (above) is Rod Laver's favourite to win this year's Wimbledon . 'His serve also seems to me to have more on it than it did last year, so he is the guy I would pick, although any of the top four could do it.' Laver is eagerly anticipating Wednesday’s quarter-final between Andy Murray and Grigor Dimitrov, but reckons the improvements in the Murray game from the past two years will probably see him through. 'Before he joined up with Ivan Lendl he was patting the ball back too much, but Andy listened and now he is taking it to his opponents more. I would still like to see him at the net more than he is. 'I think Grigor is going to be a great player, he has all the shots. But if Murray isn’t making any errors, that’s going to create a lot of pressure.' Changes: Laver believes tennis is 'a completely different sport' to the one he once played . While Laver has the Centre Court equivalent named after him at the Australian Open, he is happy sitting in the members’ seats at the All England Club, and occasionally the Royal Box. He was among the many who noticed Ilie Nastase sitting there on Monday decked out in uniform. 'Was it a military outfit or something?' asks the famously mild-mannered Laver, who in his new autobiography singled out Nastase as one of the very players he struggled to get along with. 'Ilie has never seemed to care if he is hurting other people, he has that way about him. He thinks it’s all funny. He would get angry and do things to denigrate the crowd or be rude to women umpires. I ended up asking not to have to play against him when I played exhibitions or veterans’ matches.' Laver went on long enough at the highest level to be reaching the last eight of big tour events at 37, and on that basis believes that Roger Federer has ‘maybe two years’ left at the top. Yet he concedes that the game he played is so utterly different to the one he watches now, however much he still enjoys it. Rivalry: Ilie Nastase (pictured) 'never seemed to care if he is hurting people' according to Laver . 'It’s so much tougher these days, when I was playing tournaments in England sometimes my first-round opponent would be a county player, not the quality they have to face now. 'The biggest difference is the rackets and strings. I always get asked how I would fare against today’s top players but it’s impossible to say because of that. 'Only if I had played with a composite racket from the age of eight or ten could you try and judge it. Someone like Nadal, he gets so much spin on the ball it’s almost impossible for him to overhit. Back in the day: Laver was ranked as world No 1 for seven consecutive years . 'I was five feet eight and a half and Ken Rosewall was five feet seven. If I played John Isner now, his kick serve into the advantage court would be going four feet over my head. 'I regret that the small man is now excluded from becoming a top player unless they have something very special about them, but I do think the modern game is great to watch. 'I also think the top four players in this era are of the highest quality we have seen.

{"prompt": "(CNN) -- Russians go to the polls on Sunday March 4 to elect a new president. Current Prime Minister Vladimir Putin is attempting to regain the post he held between 1999 and 2008. He has been a dominant force in Russian politics for more than a decade but his popularity has suffered recent setbacks. So who is challenging him and what will the poll mean for Russia? CNN examines some of the key questions. Russia recently had elections. What is this one about? Russia's top job -- that of president -- is being contested this time. It follows parliamentary elections in December in which Putin's ruling United Russia Party received 49.5% of the vote -- down from 64% four years ago. It kept United Russia in power in the lower house, called the Duma, with 238 of the 450 seats but also triggered major protests over allegations of vote rigging and ballot stuffing. Putin dismissed calls for a review, but the outgoing president Dmitry Medvedev announced political reforms in the wake of large demonstrations. Putin is now seeking to regain the presidency which he has held twice before. Russian law prevents presidents serving more that two consecutive terms so he was obliged to stand down in 2008. How is the president elected? There are effectively two systems in place. Parties represented in parliament can nominate their own candidate -- others need to collect two million signatures of support that are then scrutinized by Russia's Central Electoral Commission. Four of the five standing this year are party nominees, while independent candidate, the billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov, garnered enough support to run for the post. To gain the presidency, the candidate must secure 50% of the poll plus one vote. If this fails to happen there is a run-off between the two highest polling candidates in a second round of voting to be held within two weeks. So who is standing? There are five candidates: . Vladimir Putin of the United Russia Party. A primary focus of his campaign has been modernizing Russia's military, saying it's the only way to improve Russian standing in the world. Putin's political career . Gennady Zyuganov, nominated by the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. This is his fourth attempt to gain election to the top office. Sergey Mironov is standing for Just Russia. He is left leaning and lost the 2004 race for the presidency. Vladimir Zhirinovsky for the Liberal Democratic Party. A right-winger, this is his fifth attempt to be elected president. Mikhail Prokhorov, an independent. The billionaire produced a manifesto of democratic and economic reforms but CNN's Moscow correspondent Phil Black says he's struggling to shake off his reputation for being too close to the current regime. Metals mogul hoping to shine . Another candidate, Grigory Yavlinsky, of the non-parliamentary party Yabloko, was barred from standing by the Central Electoral Commission for invalid signatures -- a move his website suggests was politically motivated. Who is likely win? Despite a drop in popularity, CNN correspondent Phil Black says Putin is very likely to regain the presidency. A recent poll for the Russian Public Opinion Research Center showed him to be on 55% with none of the other candidates polling more than 10%. Putin's drawing power . Black says although Putin is clear favourite to win, he can expect continued public dissent. \"He'll be leader of a country that has changed dramatically in the last three months,\" he said. How long does the president serve? The president is entitled to stay in office for six years. It used to be four years but the constitution was changed in 2008 to allow the extension to six. Russian presidents cannot serve more than two consecutive terms. Vladimir Putin can run again despite two previous presidencies as he is currently in the post of prime minister. How powerful is the president? In Russia, the president is more powerful than the prime minister. Professor Richard Sakwa, an Associate Fellow of the Russia and Eurasia Program at London-based think-tank Chatham House, explains that the president is responsible for foreign policy and security and has the power to dismiss the prime minister. He says there are two key camps in this election -- those that see Putin as a safe pair of hands providing stability and security, and those that feel he has overstayed his welcome and want a \"move away from heavy-handed political management.\" The current president, Dmitry Medvedev, has already been nominated for prime minister by Putin if he wins -- once again swapping roles. In December, Daniel Treisman, a professor of political science at the University of California in the U.S., told CNN: \"Switching places, although hardly an inspired move, is the simplest way to stir the waters without fear of rocking the boat. Yet the reality is that Putin's return to the Kremlin will not, in itself, change much. For the last four years, he has made all key decisions, with Medvedev's advice, and he will continue to do so.\" Professor Sakwa adds: \"If Medvedev is prime minister I think he will continue to push through political reform. The prime minister is quite an important figure.\" Are there any fears about electoral fraud? The parliamentary elections in December were marred by allegations of ballot stuffing with the Organization for Security and Cooperation saying in a preliminary report that some political parties had been prevented from running and the vote was \"slanted in favor of the ruling party.\" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the U.S. also had serious concerns. Thousands of Russians turned out to protest. In response, Medvedev announced political reforms to address discontent. He proposed that Russia returned to direct election of regional governors; simplify the registration of political parties and presidential candidates; establish new editorially independent public TV channel; and called for lifting of many of the political restrictions imposed in the past several years by Putin. Phil Black reports that Putin wants to install 300,000 cameras in 90,000 polling stations at an estimated cost of $1 billion to prevent fraud. But Alexei Navalny, a leading opposition figure, told Black that they don't have any confidence in what Putin says and believe the move to install cameras is a \"gimmick.\" What about wider corruption? Dmitry Medvedev has worked to stamp out corruption in Russia, signing a 2008 decree to counter its effects. Despite this, Russia remains ranked 143rd out of 182 countries on a corruption perception index published by Transparency International. Pavel Ivlev, founder and chairman of the Committee for Russian Economic Freedom, told CNN in January that \"the average citizen has experienced the brutality of corruption carried out day-to-day by an omnipresent and thuggish bureaucracy. \"Each year an estimated 15-20% of Russia's economic output goes towards some sort of bribe - whether paying off tax authorities, the police or other local officials -- thus creating a significant drag on small businesses and innovation.\" Although Sakwa believes many in Russia never have to pay a bribe he added that there are others, particularly business people, who do have to. \"The tolerance level has come to a point where they've had enough of this.\" If Medvedev returns as prime minister after the presidential election his reforms will be further tested."}

{"prompt": "(CNN) -- Watching the premiere of \"The Informant!\" -- the Matt Damon movie about a high-level FBI mole at a large multinational company -- was the mole himself, Mark Whitacre. Mark Whitacre, right, at the premiere of 'The Informant' with Matt Damon. The movie is a dark comic take on the three years Whitacre -- a former divisional president of Archer Daniels Midland, the US-based food additive giant -- spent working undercover to break a global price-fixing conspiracy. Whitacre recognized real episodes in his life on the big screen, such as trying to fix a hidden tape player during a meeting and his delusional belief he would be made CEO of the company as a reward for his undercover work. But what you won't see in the movie are the events of August 9, 1995, six weeks after an FBI raid blew the case into public attention. It was two days after ADM fired Whitacre and accused him of embezzling millions from the company. His FBI partners for the previous three years would no longer speak with him. On that day, Whitacre sat alone in his car with its engine running inside a closed garage and slowly lost consciousness. He was hoping to end his life as surely as he had ended his career. A gardener found him unconscious. Some scenes just can't be played for laughs. \"There was nothing comical in the reality of the story,\" said Whitacre, who eventually spent nearly nine years in prison for his role in the price-fixing scheme and revelations he siphoned off $9 million from the company while he was working for the FBI. For Whitacre, 'The Informant!' is a study in his own mental illness, as he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after hospitalization for his suicide attempt. His meeting with Damon at the premiere was the first time the pair met. Damon told him he hoped they portrayed his illness in a sensitive way, Whitacre said. \"He didn't want to talk to a 52-year-old Mark Whitacre while preparing for the role, the Mark Whitacre who went to prison, who has been treated for bipolar disorder, who is now COO of a company,\" said Whitacre, who is now an executive for a small food supplement maker. \"He wanted to portray the 35-year-old Mark Whitacre, otherwise it would make it difficult to portray the delusions I had at that time.\" The fix is in . For companies and regulators, the 1997 conviction of ADM was a landmark event, the first antitrust action in the United States since World War II and a case that has spurred price-fixing investigations around the world. \"As a result of this case, the Department of Justice and the FBI started looking around to see if they could find any other cases like this,\" said Dean Paisley, a retired FBI agent who supervised the undercover ADM work. \"This used to be relatively unusual until the (ADM) case came to light,\" said John Connor, a Purdue University researcher on cartel activity, who was an expert witness in the government's case against ADM. \"Back in 1993 you'd see maybe one or two global (price-fixing schemes) being discovered ... in the past three years or so, there are about 50 a year.\" Price-fixing schemes -- where a cartel of manufacturers inflate prices against market demand -- cost consumers untold millions each year. In the ADM case, it was found that in the three-year period of investigation the company's cartel activity with manufacturers in Japan and Korea inflated prices by at least $200 million. The ADM case resulted in a record $100 million fine in 1997 -- a figure long since dwarfed. Last month Japanese company Epson agreed to pay $26 million for its role in price-fixing LCD panels used in mobile phones in the U.S. Several other companies, including Sharp, LG and Hitachi, have already pleaded guilty in the case and paid fines of more than $600 million. Just last week, the Hungarian government fined Visa Europe, MasterCard and seven commercial banks a total of $10.4 million for price fixing bank fees (Visa and MasterCard are appealing that decision). Flawed heroes . A sign of cartel activity is usually a sharp and uniform increase in price with a contraction in demand. \"But, in fact, in the last 15 or 20 years (governments) have relied almost exclusively on whistle-blowers to make their cases,\" Connor said. And as Whitacre showed, whistle blowers often don't have noble motives. \"The movie should be taken very, very seriously,\" said Sam Antar, a CPA who turned government witness against his employer in the 1980's. \"In white-collar cases, the governments have to rely on informants ... in effect, relying on unsavory characters to make their case,\" said Antar, who now advises government agencies on white-collar crime. \"What happened in 'The Informant,' is he had an agenda to become head honcho of the company,\" Antar said. \"The mistake the FBI agents made in the movie is they fell in love with their witness. It turned out there was a dark side they didn't know about.\" Whitacre said he began stealing millions from the company while working for the FBI, in part, as a financial backstop in case things went wrong. \"I had this sense of false entitlement, like they owe me this ... after all, the company was stealing hundreds of millions.\" The stress of his double-life undoubtedly added to his mental woes, said Paisley, the original FBI supervisor in the case. He points out that undercover FBI agents receive surveillance training and are pulled for psychological evaluation once a year -- Whitacre received none of that. \"There were no provisions for similar checks and balances with Whitacre,\" Paisley said. \"He had no ideas what he was getting into when he agreed to cooperate ... we had no idea it would last three years.\" Although Whitacre has served his time, Paisley and other agents involved in his case are seeking a presidential pardon. \"He really screwed up by stealing,\" Paisley said. \"Be that as it may, how many hundreds of millions would have been stolen if (ADM) wasn't stopped by Mark Whitacre? He is a national hero, in my eyes.\""}

{"prompt": "The government of the small Mediterranean island of Malta recently announced proposals to start selling citizenship of its nation to foreigners for €650,000 (about $888,000). But faced with rising criticism both in Malta and other European Union countries, the Maltese government has temporarily halted the law's implementation and will review its requirements. The European Parliament is to hold a debate on the scheme on 15 January 2014. \"The citizenship scheme as adopted by the Maltese Parliament in recent weeks seems to be a clear abuse of EU citizenship and Schengen rules, said European People's Party chairman Joseph Daul. \"Even if the Maltese give in to reason, and drop this scheme, it remains important that the European Parliament debates this issue.\" But Malta continues to defend the program, which is said to target affluent individuals in order to boost Malta's economy, but insists: \"It's not an over-the-counter sale of citizenships, said Kurt Farrugia, head of Communications for the Maltese government. \"Applicants have to go through a thorough due diligence screening process, he told CNN. \"We are still discussing the details and regulations and there might be amendments made, for example to the fee of €650,000,\" Farrugia said. The unique program, would give holders of this Maltese passport a tremendous amount of liberty. Unlike other similar programs in the European Union, applicants for program are not obliged to live in Malta before being granted a passport. Instead, if the application is successful and the applicant is wealthy enough to spare the large sum, he or she will get a  Maltese passport -- and therefore EU citizenship -- immediately. So, the applicant could theoretically live in any of the other 27 member states of the European Union. Malta joined the EU in 2004; it is a member of the Schengen borderless travel area, and has a visa waiver agreement with the United States -- all perks that would come with Maltese citizenship for foreigners. Maltese citizenship already allows a holder to travel to 163 countries across the globe without a visa. Malta's Prime Minister Joseph Muscat has predicted that the scheme will bring in more than $41 million (€30 million) annually, and help ease the country's deficit, while also attracting \"high value\" people who could potentially invest in the island. Henley & Partners, an international firm specializing in international immigration and citizenship law, will administer the initiative. \"Of course Malta is trying to raise capital with the program, but it is also opening its doors to a very beneficial segment of the world population, said Eric Major, the company's CEO. \"Many people conduct businesses abroad, but they are restricted by the passports they hold to do international travel,\" he added. The change of plan means people can register their interest in the scheme with Henley & Partners, but cannot officially apply until the Maltese government reveals its planned amendments. Once the law goes into effect, applicants will have to go through a 4-tier due diligence process. After filling out the application documents, the application is reviewed on online databases, this is followed by a background check and a risk assessment which examines the applicant's nationality, job sector and where he or she conducts business. Lastly the information is verified against government databases, including CIA, FBI and UK police files. Previous criminal convictions, misstating or fabricating information or issues with the applicant's source of wealth could all lead to an application being refused. In the best case scenario, Henley & Partners expects the whole process, from filing an application to getting a passport, to take about four to six months. \"Malta is taking many thorough steps in the vetting process,\" said Major. Major says he expected between 200 and 300 people a year to be willing to stump up the estimated $1.2 million (€850,000) cost of applying, once processing fees and other expenses are taken into account. Whether anything can be done to stop the program's implementation, still remains to be seen. The European Union said it could not interfere with citizenship decisions made by individual EU countries. \"Member states have full sovereignty to decide how and to whom they grant their nationality,\" said Tove Ernst, press officer for the European Commission. \"The European Court of Justice has on several occasions confirmed the principle of international law, that it is for each member state to lay down the conditions for the acquisition of its nationality,\" he said. Simon Busuttil, leader of Malta's opposition Nationalist Party, called the program's passage a \"black day for democracy.\" Some critics also claim that the program favors the super-rich and provides a fast-track entry into the European Union, while foreigners with no financial means are excluded from the program. Neil Falzon, director of the aditus foundation, a Malta-based human rights NGO, said: \"Many people who desperately need to come to the EU simply cannot do it and the boat tragedies out at sea are witness to this,\" he said. \"We have men, women and children fleeing wars and persecution who are unable to obtain legal entry to the EU simply because no embassy will grant them an entry visa.\" Several European Union countries offer residence permits that include free movement within the Schengen area, in exchange for high fees and the requirement to invest in the country, like Britain's Tier 1 investor scheme for non-EU citizens with £1 million ($1.6 million) or more of private funds available for investment in the UK. In contrast to other existing immigration programs, the Maltese version is an expedited citizenship program. \"The program is aimed at cash-rich but time-poor people. There is a growing breed of individuals who don't have the time to be in one country for more than four months, Major said, praising Malta's PM as \"a visionary who sees the benefits of globalization.\" Read more: Europe's golden visas lure rich Chinese .

{"prompt": "By . Corey Charlton for MailOnline . Football could become a much more literal term if a group of U.S. soccer moms have their way. A lawsuit filed against Fifa by the group argues the governing body hasn't done enough to protect players from the medical risks of heading the ball. The group behind the lawsuit are parents of young players, who claim their children are at risk of long term injury due to repeated heading of the ball and concussion. The lawsuit wants Fifa to enact new laws which include temporary subs when a player suffers a head injury . The lawsuit argues for changes in the Laws of the Game - the sport's governing rules - that include limiting the number of headers for players under 17 and including temporary substitutions when a player suffers a head injury. Cited in the lawsuit as an example is the injury suffered by German midfielder Christoph Kramer, who continued playing for 14 minutes in the World Cup final after suffering a nasty collision. He later admitted he could not remember the entire first half of the game. The lawsuit accuses Fifa of being 'careless and negligent' in its duty to provide players with proper protection from concussion. It states: 'There is an epidemic of concussion injuries in soccer at all levels around the world, including in the United States, from youth to professionals, from elite players to children playing for the first time, women and men, girls and boys. The lawsuit cites the example of Christoph Kramer in the World Cup final. The Germany midfielder played on for 14 minutes after a collision before he collapsed and was substituted . 'Fifa presides over this epidemic, and is one of its primary causes.' Earlier this month Dr Michael Grey, a motor neuro-science expert at the University of Birmingham, called for children to be completed banned from heading the ball. The expert said the impact of the brain against the skull causes damage and children’s neck muscles are not developed enough to handle the shock of impact. Former Irish international Kevin Kilbane told the Daily Telegraph: 'Football is a contact sport and you are putting your body on the line, so of course there are risks. 'I'm not sure exactly how they would count the number of headers anyway.'"}

According to court documents, Burton asked for a hug, and then began stabbing her in the face and neck. During the attack, she was screaming as loud as she could, hoping someone would hear. A young couple who did not want to be publicly identified happened to be in Crest Lake Park. Recovery: She suffered a slash to the right side . of her face that severed a nerve. The knife also grazed her carotid . artery, which meant she was in serious danger of bleeding out . Roving: Ms Dohme, pictured before the attack, still has a long road ahead of her . Law and order: Ms Dohme wrote: 'Ran into these two great men tonight, detectives Ruhlin and Sena! These are the ones working on my case and were able to get the jerk (putting it nicely) to confess his guilt' According to a police report, the couple – who are both in their late teens – yelled at Burton to stop and said he was going to kill her. The man attempted to push the 245-pound Burton off of Ms Dohme, but was unable to. Meanwhile, the young woman tried to help Ms Dohme escape to safety and called 911. Ms Dohme told the Tampa Bay Times that the couple’s intervention likely saved her live. '(Burton) would have stabbed me 'til I was dead', she told the Times. 'I know it's a miracle that I am still here. Even the trauma doctor in his notes wrote, nothing short of miraculous.' The couple left, and Burton had allegedly gone back to his truck to retrieve a bigger knife. Ms Dohme had lost pints of blood already, and was fading. Burton was later found after he crashed his car some distance away. He was believed to have overdosed on sleeping pills. Doctors rushed her to Bayfront, where she underwent several surgeries, and was given 12 units of blood. She suffered a slash to the right side of her face that severed a nerve. The knife also grazed her carotid artery, which meant she was in serious danger of bleeding out. Ms Dohme later counted 32 stab wounds, 18 of which were deep. ‘I know it’s a miracle that I am still here,’ she told Bay News 9 in an interview earlier this month. ‘Even the trauma doctor in his notes wrote, nothing short of miraculous.’ But her fighting spirit, as well as her faith helped her persevere. ‘He didn’t win and I won,’ she told the Times. Within days of the near-lethal attack, . Ms Dohme was able to breathe on her own, could grasp a pencil, and could . walk down the hallways of the ICU . She had to regularly attend speech therapy and get check-ups with other specialists. Remarkably, she went home three weeks later, and finished out her classes at St Petersburg College, earning A’s in her Humanities and Sociology classes. Burton faces assault charges in addition to first-degree attempted murder charges. Ms Dohme hasn’t let the injury slow her down. Though she completes seven hours of rehab weekly, she continues to be the bright, smiling young woman she was before the attack. She is currently backpacking through Europe with a few girlfriends, and has received an outpouring of support from friends and family. Her brush with death hasn’t stopped her from pursuing her dream – becoming a neo-natal nurse. And more than anything, nearly losing everything has shown her a new appreciation for the small tings. ‘I’ve never loved life so much, I’ve never been so appreciative, I really appreciate every day,’ she told Bay News 9."}

As the Daily Mail’s investigation into allegations of appalling failings of Welsh patients dominated Prime Minister’s Questions, David Cameron accused Labour of causing the crisis by slashing NHS funding. He told MPs that the British Medical Association and even some Labour MPs were now calling for a public inquiry in Wales into claims of neglect, long waiting lists and poor access to lifesaving treatments. Facing questions: Ed Miliband at Prime Ministers' Questions yesterday, where he heard even some Labour MPs are calling for a public inquiry into the state of the Labour-run Welsh NHS - the focus of a Mail investigation . The Prime Minister also challenged Labour leader Mr Miliband to allow a separate review by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to go ahead. The international body wants to compare health services in the four nations of the UK. The Prime Minister rejected the Labour leader’s claim that the health and social care systems in England are at ‘breaking point’, with ‘millions of people unable to see their GP’ and ‘the longest waits in A&E for ten years’. Mr Cameron said under the Coalition, 1.3million more outpatients are being treated by 2,500 more nurses and 8,000 more doctors. ‘A record we can be proud of,’ he said. ‘Why? Because we invested in the NHS, they cut the NHS in Wales.’ Strain: Ed Miliband is under intense pressure to agree to two inquiries into Labour’s health service in Wales . The fourth day of the Mail’s investigation reveals how: . Yesterday the Liberal Democrats also attacked Labour’s record, accusing the party of ‘wrecking’ the NHS in Wales. Norman Lamb, the party’s health minister, said: ‘Labour will not back an independent OECD study into the NHS in Wales is because they are scared of the outcome. ‘Ed Miliband and [shadow health secretary] Andy Burnham refused to protect NHS funding in this Parliament and they can’t be trusted with it in government again.’ Mr Cameron said under the Coalition, 1.3million more outpatients are being treated by 2,500 more nurses and 8,000 more doctors. 'A record we can be proud of,’ he said. ‘Why? Because we invested in the NHS' Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb said: ‘It’s quite wrong of the Welsh Labour Party to seek to shut down debate and shut down scrutiny…when it comes to the most important issue for the people of Wales.’ Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt upped the pressure on Mr Miliband by writing to him urging him to support the OECD study ‘according to the timetable that was previously agreed with the Welsh health minister’. He added: ‘These are the facts about the Labour-run NHS in Wales today: The health budget was cut by 8 per cent; the last time A&E targets were met was in March 2008; the eight-minute ambulance response time target has been met once since May 2012.’ A senior Labour source said: ‘What we have here is a politically-motivated smear campaign by a Prime Minister who has forgotten his job is to save the NHS.’ The source said Labour had made clear it is willing for the OECD to review the health service’s record in Wales, but was concerned the Tories would use draft findings for political purposes. Last night, ambulance service trust chief Tracy Myhill apologised to patients and families ‘whose experience of our services has been unacceptable’ and she insisted that performance was improving."}

Danya Cope was listening to music through her headphones when she was hit as she crossed a road near her home in Plymouth, Devon. The 15-year-old's body was so badly crushed her mother could not tell if she was dead or alive as she lay trapped under the HGV's wheels. Danya broke her collarbone, pelvis, rib and leg and was left with a shattered bone poking out of her ankle. Danya Cope, 15, was left fighting for her life after she was hit by a lorry in February. Doctors were forced to cut a six to eight inch hole in her skull to reach her brain . Danya (pictured left before the accident) has just had an operation to put an acrylic plate onto the hole in her skull which will fuse with her own skullbone over time (pictured right) Danya broke her collarbone, pelvis, rib and leg and was left with a shattered bone poking out of her ankle . Her head was so badly injured she was taken straight into surgery where doctors had to slice away a six to eight-inch chunk of her skull to reach her brain. Her family was told that even if she survived she faced being in a coma for six months. But against the odds, the teenager woke up nine days later and doctors began operations to patch over the gaping hole in her head with an acrylic plate. Seven months on and Danya is ready to return to  school. The accident  happened in February as Danya was listening to music through her headphones as she walked to school. Her mother Zarina Cope emerged to find her daughter critically injured in the road, a scene she said must be 'every parent's worst nightmare'. Ms Cope, a supervisor at Clinton Cards, said: 'She left the house and I heard this awful noise. I just knew it was her. Zarina Cope said that seeing her daughter in the road trapped under the wheels of a HGV was 'every mother's worst nightmare' Danya was in hospital for three months and spent the summer wearing a special helmet to protect her brain . 'She was under the lorry and she was making noises. She didn't see it coming which probably saved her life in the way she fell. She doesn't remember any of it.' Danya was taken to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth but was then flown straight up to Bristol Children's Hospital. By the time Ms Cope arrived at the hospital Danya was already in surgery. She was told the devastating news that her daughter might not survive the operation. Ms Cope said: 'One of the surgeons came out after about an hour and a half and said they had done the operation but said she probably wouldn't survive. 'It was awful. Just to see her underneath the lorry - you just think 'is she alive or dead? 'But to hear she might not survive - there are no words to describe how I felt. 'They said she could be in a coma for three to six months. It was just like a waiting game of not knowing when she would wake up. But nine days later she did. 'The first words she said when she properly opened her eyes were 'I love you mum', which was so lovely to hear.' Danya was in hospital for three months and spent the summer wearing a special helmet to protect her brain. She has recently allowed home after her final operation, in which an acrylic plate was fitted to her skull to cover the hole created by the accident. Danya said: 'It still feels numb but feels pretty much normal. It felt heavy at first. 'I can't wait to get out of the house and back to school' says Danya, who will rejoin her Year 11 class soon . When Danya first opened her eyes after coming out of surgery, her first words were: 'I love you mum' 'The plate will mould into one with my skull. The stitches shouldn't take too long to fall out and then there is just three months where I might be likely to get an infection, but after that everything is done. 'My friends have all been amazing and supportive and I'm so glad I had them there. I can't wait to get out of the house and back to school.' Danya said that after her ordeal she wants to urge people to look twice as they cross the road. She added: 'I had my headphones in and was looking at my phone to pick a song. I must have just stepped out. That's all I remember. 'I broke my collar bone, one rib, had a fractured leg, pelvis and all the skin gone from my leg. 'I had a skin graft from my foot onto my ankle where the bone was sticking out.' Ms Cope lives with partner John Tremblett, 33, a plasterer, who has been Danya's stepdad since she was six. The couple also have a son, Ashby, four. The whole family have been amazed at Danya's recovery but they are anxious to warn other children not to listen to music as they cross the road. They said they do not blame the lorry driver for the accident, adding he was not charged with any offences. Ms Cope said: 'When we got back we tried to find out what happened to him. We didn't want to press charges, it was nothing more than an accident. 'We saw him when it happened and he was mortified.' The whole family have been amazed at Danya's recovery but they are anxious to warn others kids not to listen to music as they cross the road . Ms Cope added that she is proud of Danya for showing such resilience in a difficult situation. She said: 'Danya has handled it really well. If I had woken up in that situation and been told I had no skull on part of my head I would have been so freaked out. 'There were a few days when she cried but she has been so brave and resilient. 'All the doctors and nurses were amazed at her flying spirit and ability to heal really well. She has taken it all in her stride. 'She's my little miracle. I hope Danya realises how lucky she is and has a second lease of life.'"}
{"prompt": "Federal health authorities Monday added 58 types of cancer to the list of covered illnesses for people who were exposed to toxins at the site of the World Trade Center in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. The addition finalizes a recommendation from Dr. John Howard, administrator of the World Trade Center Health Program. Howard proposed in June that the program accept the recommendations of its Science/Technical Advisory Committee and add some cancers to the coverage list -- 14 categories in all. Firefighters responding to 9/11 at increased cancer risk . The advisory committee review called for expanded \"coverage for certain types of cancer resulting from exposure to toxins released at Ground Zero.\" \"The publication of this final rule marks an important step in the effort to provide needed treatment and care to 9/11 responders and survivors through the WTC Health Program,\" Howard said in a statement Monday. The rule is expected to be published Wednesday in the Federal Register, and will take effect 30 days after its publication, Howard said. 9/11 detective dies after battle with lung cancer . First responders, volunteers, survivors of the attacks and residents near the site who meet specific qualifications will be eligible for coverage, according to the World Trade Center Health Program. According to the proposed rule, an estimated 950 to 2,150 people would take advantage of the additional coverage. The estimated cost for the total cancer treatment ranges between $14.5 million and $33 million, the proposal said. The original bill as passed by the House had a 30-year compensation program, but the Senate reduced it to five years. Many cancers may not appear for decades after an exposure, according to experts. The World Trade Center Health Program was created as a result of the passage of the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act. The Zadroga Act, passed by Congress in December 2010, is designed to provide medical services and compensation for responders who were exposed to toxins while working at ground zero. President Barack Obama signed the $4.2 billion legislation in January 2011. The law is named after a New York police officer who died of a respiratory disease attributed to working amid the toxic chemicals at the attack site. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg hailed the addition Monday. \"Tomorrow we will remember those we lost to the 9/11 terrorist attacks and also those who bravely responded during and after the tragedy,\" he said in a statement. \"As part of our ongoing commitment to our first responders, New York City led the way in ensuring that the Zadroga Act included reviews of the medical evidence so that all those ill from exposure to the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks receive the care they need. \"We have urged from the very beginning that the decision whether or not to include cancer be based on science; Dr. Howard's decision, made after thorough consideration of the latest available research and data, will continue to ensure that those who have become ill due to the heinous attacks on 9/11 will get the medical care they need and deserve,\" Bloomberg said. 9/11 responders wait for compensation for their illnesses . New York Reps. Carolyn B. Maloney, Jerrold Nadler and Peter T. King, said in a joint statement in June the proposal \"helps pave the way for expanding the scope of available medical care and compensation for those sickened by the toxins at Ground Zero.\" \"As we have all seen with our own eyes again and again, cancer incidence among responders and survivors is a tragic fact, and we must continue to do everything we can to provide the help that those who are sick need and deserve,\" the lawmakers said. The move is an about-face from Howard's announcement in July 2011, when he stated that cancer treatments would not be covered by the compensation fund. At the time, Howard said there was inadequate \"published scientific and medical findings\" to link September 11 exposures to cancer.

In trouble: George Zimmerman was granted bail on Tuesday following his Monday arrest from a domestic dispute . George Zimmerman has been released from jail after posting $9,000 bail - but not before his wife Shellie served him with divorce papers while he was behind bars. Zimmerman, who was arrested Monday after his girlfriend Samantha Scheibe called 911 saying that he threatened her with a double-barrel shotgun, has been dodging his estranged wife's attempts to legally notify him that she wants a divorce.

Zimmerman, who was acquitted this summer of murdering teenager Trayvon Martin, is 'millions' of dollars in debt and relying on public defenders for his legal team, his attorney revealed. TMZ.com reports that Shellie Zimmerman has been trying to divorce George since September - but she can't because court agents have not been able to track him down and hand him the paperwork formally notifying him of the divorce. He finally got the paperwork today in the Seminole County jail. Zimmerman was seen for the first time since on Tuesday when his two new lawyers accompanied him to the first appearance hearing where a judge heard arguments over whether or not he should be released on bail while waiting for his charges to be brought to court on January 7.

In . addition, the judge explained that he was assigning the $9,000 bail bond . by valuing the aggravated assault charge at $8,900 and $100 for each of . the misdemeanor charges of battery and criminal mischief that he faces. He will also have to remain in the state of Florida, wear an ankle monitoring bracelet, and surrender any and all weapons.

A 'barbaric' thug who admitted attacking a bus passenger because he complained about children throwing sweets at him has been jailed. Jason Wilson, 35, was on the number 24 bus in Birmingham City Centre with his partner, Laura Breckneall, 34, her 10-year-old son and her daughter, when 21-year old Ashley Madden asked the children to stop throwing sweets at him. The court heard that Wilson then walked to the back of the bus, sat next to Mr Madden and spat in his face. In full view of the children, Wilson punched and kicked Mr Madden, jumping up on the seats to get a better angle. Ms Breckneall passed Wilson a bottle of Jif lemon juice which he squirted in Mr Madden's eyes. She was initially arrested but all charges against her were dropped at a later hearing. 'Shocking' CCTV footage of the seven minute attack, which included kicks, knees and punches, was shown to Birmingham Crown Court today. Mr Madden had to be taken to hospital after the attack and was left with a bruised nose, swelling and bruising to his left eye, and breathing difficulties. Jailing Wilson for 18 months Recorder Martine Kushner said: 'What I saw on the screen was truly, truly shocking. 'A child needs boundaries, he doesn't need to see an assault being carried out by the person who looks after him. You could have just moved away.

'All I can do is give you a custodial sentence. Anybody who sees the CCTV would think it is significantly serious.' Officers from West Midlands Police released the minute-long video taken by CCTV cameras in February - which led to a flood of people naming Wilson as the attacker. He then eventually handed himself into a police station on February 20. The attack was watched by Mr Wilson's girlfriend, Laura Breckneall, 34, and her two children - a son, aged 10, who suffers from ADHD and Asperger's and a daughter .

'The defendant also got on with his partner and her two children. One of the children who was 10-years-old was throwing sweets over his shoulder. 'Ashley Madden asked this defendant, who he assumed was with the boy, to stop throwing the sweets. 'The defendant then made his way over to him and spat in his face. 'Ashley Madden's reaction was to punch him, but it was then that an extreme amount of violence was used on this complainant who was essentially trapped in the corner. 'He is a big man and his punched, he kicked. The assault was prolonged and sustained. Wilson admitted assault occasioning ABH at an earlier hearing at Birmingham Crown Court . Police initially released CCTV in February when Wilson and Laura Breckneall were quickly identified. Ms Breckneall was originally arrested and charged, but the charges were dropped at an earlier hearing . 'The defendant went off and came back for more. On one occasion he lifts himself up off the floor and kicks the defendant in the face and then he squirted lemon juice in his face. 'It was used in order to blind the complainant and to degrade him. There was also an attempt to take his mobile phone in an attempt to prevent him from calling the police.'

{"prompt": "Senseless: Delbert Belton an 88-year-old veteran of World War II was beaten to death outside the Eagles Lodge in Spokane, and police have arrested two teens in connection with the murder . The 88-year-old World War II veteran who was randomly beaten to death Wednesday likely died because he tried to fend off his attackers. Two teenage boys are charged in the bloody beating of Delbert Belton outside a Spokane, Washington ice skating rink and investigators are now suggesting the soldier—who took a bullet in the Battle of Okinawa—tried to stop the apparent robbery. Police say that enraged the teens and turned their petty theft into full-blown murder as they continued to beat him into submission with ‘big, heavy flashlights.’ ‘Our information is that the individual fought back and that may have made this, you know, a worse situation,’ said Spokane Police Chief Frank Straub in a Monday press conference. Straub was quick to maintain Belton’s innocence in the matter. ‘I'm not being critical of Mr. Belton,’ he clarified. ‘We certainly encourage individuals to fight back, and he should have. But it shouldn't have happened to begin with.’ The second fugitive teenager wanted in connection with the brutal murder was arrested morning after a four-day man-hunt. Kenan Adams-Kinard, 16, was the second teen to be arrested for the murder of Belton. The teen was arrested on a 1st degree robbery and 1st degree murder warrant and was brought into custody by Spokane police to join fellow suspect, 16-year-old Demetrius Glenn, who was arrested on Thursday. Glenn's bail was set at an eyebrow-raising $2 million. District Judge Richard Leland, presiding over a packed courtroom, said the brutality of the attack and vulnerability of the victim make the high bail proper. Several other people found with Adams-Kinard have been arrested for rendering criminal assistance to the teen during his time in hiding. Scroll down for video .

Most wanted: Police say Adams-Kinard was arrested after a four day man-hunt . He was found in a basement apartment at 500 West Montgomery in Spokane and arrested without incident at early Monday morning according to KHQ.Com. Prior to his arrest, the family of Kenan had urged him to come forward and turn himself over to the police. 'He's . out there and if anybody knows where he's at or something, they really . need to contact the family because we are trying to bring him in,' said . Kenan's Dad, who wished to remain anonymous. 'We don't want this . prolonged, we really need to get this over with and get through with . this and find out what's really the situation, of really, what happened . in this tragedy.' As soon as she heard about Adams-Kinard's arrest, Belton's daughter-in-law made her feelings on the issue known in no uncertain terms. 'You can’t go around beating people to death and think it’s OK and not pay any consequences,' Barbara Belton told the LA Times. 'They need to pay the consequences of their action, which was horrendous.' Rather than a random murder, Kenan's uncle had previously suggested the incident was more complicated than a random attack. 'They . are building it like these kids just went and beat up an old man, which . it didn't occur like that, but it is all going to come out,' Kenan's . Uncle said to KHQ.Com. Belton, who was shot in the leg during the pivotal battle of the Pacific campaign, passed away from serious head injuries Thursday at Sacred Heart Medical Center in the city. Police told Belton's daughter-in-law, Bobby, . that he was beaten with heavy flashlights in the assault which left him . bleeding 'from every part of his face'. Witnesses to the attack said that Belton, who was going to play pool, was outside the Eagles Lodge at around 8pm when two male suspects set upon him. A friend said the veteran had just pulled up and was waiting for a female friend so she didn't have to walk in alone. Surrender: Glenn turned himself in to police custody through his lawyer . 'It . does appear random. He was in the parking lot, it appears he was . assaulted in the parking lot and there was no indication that he would . have known these people prior to the assault,' Spokane Police Major . Crimes Detective Lieutenant Mark Griffiths said. On Thursday evening, police released surveillance photos of the two suspects, Glenn and Kinard.

He urged anyone who sees him . or has information on his whereabouts to call 911 at once. Glenn turned himself in to police custody through his attorney just before 10pm Thursday. Officers noticed that the teen had an abrasion on his right hand, according to an affidavit. While being questioned by police, Glenn was asked to stand up and show what he was wearing. 'These are not the shorts from the video,' Glenn said, according to the report, apparently referring to the surveillance footage. Glenn, who spells his first name as 'Demetruis' on social media sites, described himself on his Twitter account in this manner: 'I Play Foot-ball,Run Tracc [sic],Get Money Do What i do,im a guy but i like the show keeping up with the kardashians.'

Wanted: Police released images of two possible suspects . Suspect Number Two: Police caught the two teens who assaulted 88-year-old Delbert Belton outside the Eagles Lodge in North Spokane Wednesday night . Family members were today grieving for the widower, who is survived by one son Bill, 65, who is currently in hospital himself. Daughter-in-law Bobby Belton told KREM-TV she received the police call and had to break the news to her ill husband. 'They used those great, big heavy flashlights,'' she said. 'The doctor said he was bleeding from all parts of his face. 'You expect older people to die but not in that way. You just don't do those kind of things' His sister Alberta Tosh told the Spokesman Review: 'He was a good guy who would help anybody if they needed help,' she said. His great-nephew Allen Hills told KHQ that the veteran took him in and put him back on his feet when he hit rock bottom. 'It seems trivial, but he really did save my life. He made it possible for me to get a job and find work,' he said. 'He wasn't just my great-uncle. He was a great person, and he didn't deserve to die like that.'

Tribute: Lill Duncan takes a photo of a memorial for Delbert Belton, the 88-year-old World War II veteran who was beaten to death, in Spokane . Friends were left equally outraged that the serviceman would die in such a callous way. 'He put his life on the line for our country to come home and 60 years later? Get beat to death?' his closest friend Ted Denison told the Review. 'That’s not right.' Denison who knew Belton for 23 years regularly played pool with the former soldier who went on to be an aluminum worker. He worked at Kaiser Aluminum’s Trentwood rolling mill until his retirement in 1982 but remained a skilled member of the Steelworkers Union. His wife died several years ago. 'He went up there and played pool, met with some of the guys he used to work with at Kaiser Aluminum,' he told CNN. 'It's really depressing. Seems that all there is is bad news.' Police said that Belton had just arrived with a lady-friend to play pool at the lodge when he was set upon. Tribute: Friends raised a drink to Delbert Benton in the bar he was murdered outside today . 'Those . people to me are cowards,' said Denison to KXLY.com. 'They are cowards when they . beat old people that are defenseless.... They need to be caught. Period. Because that's senseless. Beating an old man, what kind of person does . that? But a wimp to me.' 'He was always there for me when I needed him,' he added. 'We'd joke . back and forth. We were always having fun, some sort of fun.' Their outrage was mirrored online. On Twitter a campaign titled Justice for Delbert Belton was spreading this morning. Actor James Woods was one high profile supporter. 'Don't let him die without anyone caring,' read one of his many posts on the killing. The police are looking for two male suspects in the attack, with one described as heavy set and wearing all black clothing and the other as 6 feet tall and 150 pounds."}

The Eastern River Cooter's shell managed to protect it from thousands of pounds of pressure in the alligator's bite . The Eastern River Cooter's shell managed to protect as it lay helpless in the alligator's jaws. Many academic studies have been carried out into the forces a turtle's shell can withstand. Researchers have been continually interested in the evolution and design of the shell and applying it to human armour. Although the shell protects turtle's from most predators, larger animals such as crocodiles, alligators and even jaguars are normally able to crush the carapace in order to get to the reptile's body. Although expets say the exact strength of a shell depends on the size of the animal, researhers say the animals evolved the shell to avoid being eaten - and as these pictures show, it works. Tiger sharks can also bite through turtles of all sizes and other predators nibble around the softer edges of the armour to pull the turtle out. The protective shell is made from bone covered by a horny shield. Plates of bone are fused with ribs, vertebrae and parts of the shoulder and hip. The shape of the shell also gives it extra strength. The turtle was powerless as it was clamped in the alligator's jaws but survived because of its shell . The fight was captured by American wildlife photographer Patrick Castleberry . The images were taken by American wildlife photographer Patrick Castleberry, 51, who said he was astounded to find the turtle still alive after the alligator had abandoned it.

A third was hospitalized, and a fourth employee's fate was not yet known, the company said. None of their identities have been released. Investigators were trying to determine what caused the crash of the aircraft, a model with a good safety record flown by a well-respected airline at one of the world's most modern airports. The crash split the plane into three parts, as it was arriving at Schiphol from Istanbul, Turkey, around 10:40 a.m. (4:40 a.m. ET). Flight 1951 went down in a farmer's field about 500 yards short of the runway in favorable weather conditions. It had 135 people onboard. Among those injured in the crash, 63 remained hospitalized Thursday, six of them in critical condition, said Theo Weterings, the mayor of Haarlemmermeer municipality, where Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport is located. Another 25 passengers were severely injured, an official said Tuesday. Authorities have confirmed the nationalities of all but 15 of the passengers and crew, Weterings said.

The part was replaced, and \"after this replacement, the plane had eight take-offs and landings and there were no problems,\" Turkish Airlines said. In the wake of the disaster, Turkish Airlines executives and officials from Turkey's Transportation Ministry said the Boeing 737-800 had last been inspected December 22.   See where 737-800 has been involved in previous incidents » . \"There was no problem with maintenance in the records of the plane,\" Candan Karlicetin, executive board chairman of Turkish Airlines, said in a news conference just hours after the crash. Teams of investigators arrived at the crash site just after daybreak and set up a large white tent. They fanned out over the debris field, where the white fuselage of the Boeing lay in three pieces. A special Turkish Airlines flight landed in Amsterdam Thursday morning from Istanbul, carrying about 70 relatives of those on board the fatal flight. The relatives were accompanied by trauma specialists, the airline said. The flight data and voice recorders were recovered. Turkish officials have also ruled out weather conditions as a possible reason for the crash. Dutch and Turkish authorities say they await the results of an international investigation into the cause. Aviation experts say Turkish Airlines has a relatively good safety record, though in 2003, more then 70 people were killed when a Turkish Airlines domestic flight crashed in fog near the southeastern city of Diyarbakir. Turkey's flagship carrier had been expanding its routes and fleet of aircraft in recent years. Hollywood actor Kevin Costner was recently hired to star in an advertising campaign for the company. Costner's commercials were to be broadcast in 70 countries. An employee in Turkish Airlines' advertising department said the promotional campaign was suspended in the wake of the fatal plane crash.

The Yorkshire Ripper has enjoyed a specially-arranged baptism service in Broadmoor after becoming a Jehovah's witness. Peter Sutcliffe, 68, who was jailed for murdering 13 women, was recently baptised in a pool in a private room at the high security hospital . The serial killer has been a practicing Jehovah's Witness for several years and holds bi-weekly bible study classes. Earlier this month the Daily Mail reported on Sutcliffe's cushy lifestyle in Broadmoor, where he eats chocolate, watches television and listens to music. Despite being one of the country’s most notorious serial killers he is allowed visitors four days a week - each of whom who can stay for up to four hours. He is said to have money to spend in the psychiatric hospital’s shop, and attends a ceramics workshop and twice-weekly Bible studies sessions. In 2010 MailOnline reported Sutcliffe had been befriended over the last 15 years by Jehovah’s Witnesses, who are emphatic that he now shows remorse for his crimes. The former trucker claimed he was on a divine mission to rid the streets of prostitutes. The Sun on Sunday has now reported that two fellow Jehovah's Witness brothers from a local Kingdom Hall carried out the baptism. They quoted an unnamed source who claimed: 'Peter was really happy about being baptised and said afterwards he was now a Jehovah's Witness 'brother'. 'It is really odd that someone who did what he did is so religious now - they have even told him he will go to paradise because he has accepted God.' The source added that people who know Sutcliffe think Broadmoor is 'doing too much' to let him practice the religion. Sutcliffe has already tried to convert fellow patients at the Berkshire psychiatric hospital. Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper, after an attack by another prisoner in 1982 with a broken coffee jar . He was jailed for life in 1981 after admitting killing 13 women and attempting to murder seven more between 1975 and 1981 in Yorkshire and Greater Manchester. Mr Justice Mitting likened Sutcliffe to a ‘terrorist’, saying the ‘brutality and gravity’ of his crimes meant he should never be released. Sutcliffe has spent most of his life sentence in Broadmoor after being diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 1984. He refused treatment until 1993, when the Mental Health Commission ruled that he should be given anti-psychotic medication forcibly. He has been attacked at least three times behind bars. The second assault put his right eye out and another inmate then unsuccessfully attempted to do the same for his left. He has spent most of his sentence in Broadmoor after he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia . It costs taxpayers more than £300,000 a year to detain him in Broadmoor, at least five times the cost of a prison cell. Last year his plea to be moved to a unit in his home county of West Yorkshire was rejected. In 2010, an appeal over his sentence that could have led to him applying for parole was rejected, with a High Court judge saying he should never be released. His health has deteriorated in recent years. He had a hernia operation in 2013 and later suffered from a debilitating cough. Medication has made him put on weight and has increased his blood pressure. Sutcliffe used weapons including a hammer, screwdriver and knives to mutilate women across the north of England."}

{"prompt": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- A six-month trial was launched this week that promises to transform the way luggage is tracked and monitored at London's Heathrow airport. As many as 28 in every 1,000 passengers do not arrive at their destination at the same time as their luggage. The trial -- run by BAA and airline Emirates -- is using RFID (radio-frequency identification) technology to tag baggage. This will allow staff to more accurately track bags passing through the airport. The crucial difference between RFID and the existing barcode system is its scanning accuracy. Barcode tags can be easily damaged in transit and are also at risk of being covered when scanned. If not scanned, details must be entered manually into the system, adding time and error to the process. BAA estimates that Heathrow can read only 60 per cent of labels that pass through. RFID is reported to offer over 99 percent accuracy. The £150,000 trial -- the first of its kind in the UK -- will continue for six months tracking bags for passengers traveling with Emirates to and from Dubai, and transferring through Heathrow. A duplicate of the Heathrow system has been installed at Dubai Airport. During the check-in process at Heathrow Terminal 3, staff apply tags containing RFID chips to bags with information including the passenger's name and route. The chips are then read on entry into the baggage system; they are tracked as they move throughout; and finally on leaving the system. As a result, says Shaun Cowlam, Logistics Director at Heathrow Airport, staff can know where a bag is at \"every moment of every day\". BAA is also considering introducing a SMS text messaging service to keep passengers informed of where their bags are. When passengers arrive at Heathrow, says Cowlam, the idea will be to send passengers a text informing them what belt and what time their bags will arrive at. Ultimately, the use of RFID could extend services to frequent flyers, and provide the means to added value services such as faster check-in, and even be integrated with secure collection and delivery. The main benefits, however, will be for travelers passing through major hubs such as Heathrow and Dubai, as this system offers better processing of baggage on transfer flights. Emirates and BAA are sharing the costs of the trial. But as Vic Sheppard, Emirates Vice President for UK and Ireland says, \"cost is not an issue\", especially considering the savings the airline is expected to achieve by reducing loss and repatriation of bags. And as Cowlam adds: \"if we can introduce this across the whole network the costs will reduce significantly.\" Hong Kong International Airport was one of the first to deploy RFID technology in 2005. But as outlined in a recent survey by SITA, RFID is being used in just 6 percent of the airports surveyed. \"For this system to really take off we need other airports and other airlines to embrace the technology,\" says Cowlam. That widespread adoption may not be far off. The SITA survey indicated that RFID tags will be used in 45 percent of airports by the end of 2009. It's still early days, but BAA and Emirates are optimistic for RFID's future in airports. \"There have been giant strides in the technology in aviation in recent years. But in the last few decades there hasn't been any advancement in the methods adopted for baggage handling,\" says Sheppard. \"This is a major step forward.\" E-mail to a friend ."}

File image of armed MEND militants in Niger Delta region of Nigeria . The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) said in an e-mail message to reporters that the \"major Shell and Agip crude trunk lines in Bayelsa state\" were struck. \"The Agip pipeline which connects the Agip Brass terminal was sabotaged at Nembe creek while the Shell Nembe creek line was done at Asawo village,\" MEND said. Shell said it is investigating reports of an attack on the Nembe creek pipeline and Agip could not be reached for comment. Rabe Abubakar, spokesman for the Nigerian military's Joint Task Force, said \"the militants are telling lies\" and \"there is no iota of truth in what they are saying.\" Their claims against the Shell pipeline \"are not true,\" Abubakar said, explaining that explosives were hurled at the pipeline but the explosion was limited and it did not destroy the line. \"There was an attempt by them to blow up an Agip pipeline around 3 a.m., but the soldiers protected the place and the militants fled,\" Abubakar said. Explosives were found on a well and an explosives expert was brought in to remove them, he added. MEND -- which has declared an \"all-out war\" on the government -- demands that more of Nigeria's oil wealth be reinvested in the region, instead of enriching those whom the militants consider corrupt politicians. But fighting has continued despite Nigerian President Umaru Yar'Adua's recent call for an amnesty for the militant groups, an offer that stays open until October 4. Under the amnesty proposal, militants must hand in their weapons and take part in government rehabilitation programs. Also on Wednesday, the military said three people were seized for trying to blow up a pipeline at the Forcados River. But MEND said the military \"arrested two repentant armed youths who approached them to take advantage of the government's amnesty offer.\" \"We are learning that there are about 11 of such cases currently languishing in detention inside the JTF headquarters in Warri,\" MEND said. Last month, Amnesty International said that pollution and other environmental impacts from the oil industry in the Niger Delta are creating a \"human rights tragedy\" in which local people suffer poor health and loss of livelihood. Governments and oil companies are failing to be accountable for the problems, Amnesty said in its report, called \"Petroleum, Pollution and Poverty in the Niger Delta.\" Covering 46,500 square miles (75,000 square km), the Niger Delta is about the same size as the Czech Republic, according to the United Nations Development Programme. An area of rich biological diversity, the region contains the world's third-largest wetland with the most extensive freshwater swamp forest, according to the UNDP. More than half the area contains creeks and small islands, while the rest is rain forest, the UNDP says. At the same time, the Niger Delta produces the oil wealth that accounts for the bulk of Nigeria's foreign earnings, the UNDP says. Earlier this week, MEND said its fighters had blown up an oil pipeline and captured six crew members of a chemical tanker. MEND is now saying it has released the ship and the military says it secured the vessel. It is not clear whether the three Russians, two Filipinos and the Indian seized remain in custody. MEND told CNN that \"to their knowledge,\" the crew is no longer being held hostage. CNN's Christian Purefoy contributed to this report."}
{"prompt": "(CNN) -- The search for a U.S. man who allegedly abducted his two young sons last week focused Monday on Cuba, with a Florida sheriff's department saying it had received information that the man, his wife and sons had arrived in the island nation, possibly by sailboat. A State Department official in Washington told CNN that the U.S. Interest Section in Havana \"is aware of this case and is in contact with local authorities to get more information.\" The official would not comment further, citing \"privacy considerations.\" Authorities believe the father, Joshua Michael Hakken of Louisiana, abducted his sons Chase, 2, and Cole, 4, early Wednesday after breaking into the Florida home of the children's grandmother and tying her up. In Havana, Lynn Roche, an official with the U.S. Interest Section, said section officials couldn't discuss any case of an American who hasn't signed a privacy act waiver. And an official with Cuba's foreign ministry said Monday evening that his agency was unaware of the case and had not received any requests for help from U.S. officials. The boys had been removed from the care of Hakken and his wife, Sharyn Patricia Hakken, last year, and on Tuesday, the couple's parental rights were terminated in Louisiana, investigators say. The abduction report triggered an Amber Alert for the children, but there were no reported sightings. Joshua Hakken, described as an anti-government protester, was believed to be armed, according to the Hillsborough County sheriff's office in Tampa, the site of last week's alleged abduction. Investigators believed his wife was with him. On Monday, the sheriff's department released a statement saying it had \"received information that the Hakken family had arrived in Cuba.\" The brief statement did not offer any specifics about the information but added, \"We are currently working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation who is in contact with the U.S. State Department to verify this information.\" That followed a statement Friday from the same department saying it had obtained information that Joshua Hakken recently bought a 25-foot sailboat. There is no extradition treaty between Cuba and the United States, although there have been recent cases in which Americans sought for crimes in the United States and discovered in Havana have been sent back by the Cubans. The FBI currently estimates there are around 70 fugitives from U.S. justice in Cuba, which is one of the reasons Cuba remains on the U.S. list of countries that support state terrorism. Most of the American fugitives in Cuba have been there for decades and have ties to revolutionary movements or radical groups. On Thursday, the police department in Slidell, Louisiana, issued its own statement offering background on the Hakkens and why the boys were taken from the parents last year. In June of 2012, Slidell police responded to a disturbance report at a hotel where Joshua and Sharyn Hakken were staying with their sons, the police statement said. \"When police arrived, both Mr. and Mrs. Hakken were acting in a bizarre manner that alarmed officers. They were talking about 'completing their ultimate journey' and were traveling across the country to 'take a journey to the Armageddon,'\" the Slidell police statement said, adding, \"Let it be noted that both of their children were present in the hotel room at the time.\" Because of the parents' behavior and \"the fact that narcotics and weapons were located inside of the hotel room,\" the children were taken by child welfare officers, and Joshua Hakken was arrested on drug charges, the statement said. \"Approximately two weeks later, Slidell Police were notified that Mr. Hakken had shown up to the foster family home ... with a firearm demanding the return of his children,\" the Slidell police statement continued. \"The foster parents called 911, and Mr. Hakken fled without his children. We have heard nothing until (Wednesday).\" At some point over the past few months, the children were sent to Tampa to live with their grandmother, Patricia Hauser, the mother of Sharyn Hakken. \"Somehow they found out where the kids were,\" said Detective Larry McKinnon of the Hillsborough County sheriff's office. Sheriff's investigators say Joshua Hakken entered Hauser's home at 6:30 a.m. Wednesday. She told police that he tied her up and fled with the children in her silver 2009 Toyota Camry. That vehicle was found later that day just a couple of blocks away from the home. Those investigators told CNN they believe Joshua Hakken joined up with his wife, who was waiting in their pickup truck, and the family drove to a parking garage. A short time later, investigators said, Hakken is believed to have taken a sailboat out of a private slip in nearby Madeira Beach. Surveillance images showed the boat sailing into the Gulf of Mexico about three and a half hours after the boys disappeared from their grandmother's home, investigators said, adding that the photos showed adults and children aboard.

{"prompt": "Cairo (CNN) -- A senior Egyptian general admits that \"virginity checks\" were performed on women arrested at a demonstration this spring, the first such admission after previous denials by military authorities. The allegations arose in an Amnesty International report, published weeks after the March 9 protest. It claimed female demonstrators were beaten, given electric shocks, strip-searched, threatened with prostitution charges and forced to submit to virginity checks. At that time, Maj. Amr Imam said 17 women had been arrested but denied allegations of torture or \"virginity tests.\" But now a senior general who asked not to be identified said the virginity tests were conducted and defended the practice. \"The girls who were detained were not like your daughter or mine,\" the general said. \"These were girls who had camped out in tents with male protesters in Tahrir Square, and we found in the tents Molotov cocktails and (drugs).\" The general said the virginity checks were done so that the women wouldn't later claim they had been raped by Egyptian authorities. \"We didn't want them to say we had sexually assaulted or raped them, so we wanted to prove that they weren't virgins in the first place,\" the general said. \"None of them were (virgins).\" This demonstration occurred nearly a month after Egypt's longtime President Hosni Mubarak stepped down amid a wave of popular and mostly peaceful unrest aimed at his ouster and the institution of democratic reforms. Afterward, Egypt's military -- which had largely stayed on the sidelines of the revolution -- officially took control of the nation's political apparatus as well, until an agreed-upon constitution and elections. Mubarak denies ordering shootings . The March 9 protest occurred in Tahrir Square, which became famous over 18 historic and sometimes bloody days and nights of protests that led to Mubarak's resignation. But unlike in those previous demonstrations, the Egyptian military targeted the protesters. Soldiers dragged dozens of demonstrators from the square and through the gates of the landmark Egyptian Museum. Salwa Hosseini, a 20-year-old hairdresser and one of the women named in the Amnesty report, described to CNN how uniformed soldiers tied her up on the museum's grounds, forced her to the ground and slapped her, then shocked her with a stun gun while calling her a prostitute. \"They wanted to teach us a lesson,\" Hosseini said soon after the Amnesty report came out. \"They wanted to make us feel that we do not have dignity.\" The treatment got worse, Hosseini said, when she and the 16 other female prisoners were taken to a military detention center in Heikstep. There, she said, she and several of other female detainees were subjected to a \"virginity test.\" \"We did not agree for a male doctor to perform the test,\" she said. But Hosseini said her captors forced her to comply by threatening her with more stun-gun shocks. \"I was going through a nervous breakdown at that moment,\" she recalled. \"There was no one standing during the test, except for a woman and the male doctor. But several soldiers were standing behind us watching the backside of the bed. I think they had them standing there as witnesses.\" The senior Egyptian general said the 149 people detained after the March 9 protest were subsequently tried in military courts, and most have been sentenced to a year in prison. Authorities later revoked those sentences \"when we discovered that some of the detainees had university degrees, so we decided to give them a second chance,\" he said. The senior general reaffirmed that the military council was determined to make Egypt's democratic transition a success. \"The date for handover to a civil government can't come soon enough for the ruling military council,\" he said. \"The army can't wait to return to its barracks and do what it does best -- protect the nation's borders.\""}

End of the road: Nigel Farage said he would quit as UKIP leader if Britain votes to stay in the EU . Nigel Farage has revealed he will quit politics if Britain votes to stay in the European Union in 2017. The UKIP leader said the campaign to cut ties with Brussels would go on forever if the referendum goes against him. But he would have ‘have probably reached the end of the road’ for his own political ambitions. David Cameron has pledged to stage an in-out referendum by 2017 if he is Prime Minister after the next election. The Tory leader wants to renegotiate a fresh settlement, returning some powers to London, and has indicated he would campaign to stay in the EU. Polls suggest the result could be close, but with a small majority preferring to remain not to leave. If that was the result in four years’ time, Mr Farage suggested he would walk away from politics. He said: ‘For the overall cause, no free country ever willingly gives up the right to govern itself and the independence argument won't die but it will have been put back for a long time. ‘Personally, I would have probably reached the end of the road. If we reach that point in 2017, I will have been doing this a long time and if I haven't succeeded then I haven't succeeded,’ he told Public Service Europe. However Mr Farage insisted the debate in the run up to the referendum would see an increase in support for leaving the EU. ‘I genuinely think that a referendum on this subject would be just like the debate on whether we should join the euro. ‘The more air and the more publicity it gets, the more likely it would be that our side of the argument would win.’ Mr Farage first became leader of UKIP in 2006, but quit in 2009 to stand for Parliament in the 2010 general election. His bid to oust Commons Speaker John Bercow as an MP failed, after he dramatically survived a plane crash while campaigning on polling day. After a dire general election campaign under Lord Pearson, the party re-elected Mr Farage as leader in November 2010. Election drama: Mr Farage stood for to become an MP in 2010 and dramatically survived a plane crash on polling day when the light aircraft came down at Hinton-in-the-Hedges airfield, near Brackley . Since then the party has seen a surge in support, leap-frogging the Lib Dems in the polls and winning one in four votes in local elections in May this year. Now the party is predicting it could win elections to the European Parliament in 2014, before trying to secure its first MPs a year later. However this week the party has faced fresh accusations of racism after UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom complained about Britain sending foreign aid to ‘Bongo Bongo land’. Racism row: UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom, pictured with wife Katryna and terrier dog Chippy, sparked a storm by referring to 'Bonga Bonga land' He offered up several explanations to prove the comment it was not racist. Yesterday he insisted that a bongo is a ‘white antelope, lives in the forest, there is no connotation of racism about it whatsoever’. Critics were quick to point out that the bongo antelope is not white, it is brown. Earlier he said: ‘I don’t know where Ruritania is either – there is no such place of course is there? Like the Third World. Where is the Third World?’ And he suggested: ‘It might have been misconstrued by President Bongo of the Gambon, he may have thought I was talking about him. ‘If he is offended, I shall write to his excellency in short order and say, “I’m very sorry I wasn’t talking about you”.' However, Ali Bongo is president of Gabon, not Gambon. Repeatedly quizzed on whether he is a racist, Mr Bloom told Channel 4 News interviewer Krishnan Guru-Murthy: ‘Move on, there’s a good fellow.

{"prompt": "(CNN) -- Authorities hunting the killer of a police officer in Northern Ireland last week say they have seized a gun and ammunition. Two people in masks prepare to throw petrol bombs in Lurgan, Northern Ireland. They were found Saturday in Craigavon, the town where Stephen Carroll, 48, was shot dead on Monday, a police statement said Sunday. Authorities also arrested two more people in connection with the killing of Carroll -- a 37-year-old man and a 30-year-old woman. That brings the total in custody to five, police told CNN. And they arrested another person over the killing of two soldiers just days before Carroll was killed. A total of four people are now in custody in the killing of soldiers Cengiz \"Pat\" Azimkar, 21, and Mark Quinsey, 23, at the Massereene barracks March 7. The Massereene barracks killings were the first fatal attack on British troops in the province for more than 12 years. Carroll was the first police officer killed in political violence since 1998. The shootings have raised fears that the province could plunge back to the sectarian violence that claimed the lives of 3,600 people over three decades before the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. The Continuity IRA, a republican splinter group that does not accept the Good Friday Agreement, said it had killed Carroll, while the Real IRA, another splinter group, said it had killed the soldiers, Britain's Press Association reported. Northern Ireland's top police officer, Hugh Orde, insisted Sunday that the militant groups that want the province to leave the United Kingdom and become part of Ireland are \"small ... disrupted, infiltrated and disorganized.\" \"The current wisdom is that they number around 300 in a population of 1.75 million,\" he wrote in Britain's News of the World newspaper. But, he said: \"In the past 18 months or so there have been at least 25 attempts by dissident terrorists to kill officers on and off duty.\" Rioting flared near Belfast, the capital of Northern Ireland, after an earlier round of arrests Saturday. Police said petrol bombs were hurled at police in Lurgan, west of Belfast. There were no arrests or injuries reported, despite gangs of youths on the streets, authorities said. One of the men arrested in connection with the killing of the soldiers, Colin Duffy, 41, is from Lurgan. He was among three whose arrests were announced Saturday. A fourth man was arrested Saturday night, said the police spokeswoman, who declined to be named in line with policy. She released no details about the man or the location of the arrest. The two British soldiers were shot dead a week ago at a base in Massereene, in Antrim, as they were preparing to ship out for duty in Afghanistan. The soldiers had packed their bags and changed into their uniforms, authorities said. Two masked gunmen with automatic rifles shot them as the soldiers picked up a pizza delivery at the barracks, authorities said. Two other soldiers and the two pizza delivery men were seriously wounded. Politicians from across the political spectrum have condemned the killings, with Sinn Fein deputy leader Martin McGuinness calling the killers \"traitors to the island of Ireland.\" Sinn Fein is a predominantly Catholic party that wants Northern Ireland to leave the United Kingdom and become part of the Republic of Ireland. The party is widely thought to be linked to the Irish Republican Army. Danny Kennedy, deputy leader of the loyalist Ulster Unionist Party, which wants Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom, also condemned the attack as \"wicked and murderous.\""}

One thing you can safely assume when Andy Murray renews acquaintance with Rafael Nadal is that there will be no repeat of the last two sets they played. Strangely, that was more than two and a half years ago when the now Wimbledon champion blew him away 6-2, 6-0 in the last two sets of the Japan Open final. This will be on clay in the Italian Open quarter final, something very different. It is the Big Four rivalry that has ground to a standstill after three Grand Slams in 2011 that saw them meet in the semi-finals, with the Spaniard emerging victorious on each occasion. Concentrated: Andy Murray returns a forehand during his victory over Jurgen Melzer . Resistance: Melzer provided stiff competition for the British No 1 . Best wishes: A fan at the Italian Open sends her birthday greetings to Andy Murray . For a time . on Thursday it seemed that it would be Nadal who might stand Murray up . on this particular date, as he trailed Mikhail Youznhy by a set and a . break before roaring back to win 6-7, 6-2, 6-1. The . Scot, playing on his 27th birthday, had earlier kept his side of the . bargain with a 7-6, 6-4 victory over Austria’s Jurgen Melzer in a . further sign that he might be coming to the boil, albeit slowly, ahead . of the French Open and Wimbledon. We . will find out more on Friday and not just about Murray. By his . extraordinary standards on clay Nadal has been struggling, and again . relied on his remarkable fighting powers to overcome the Russian, just . as he had against France’s Gilles Simon on Wednesday night. Murray . agreed that it was curious the two – who of the old ‘Big Four’ are . probably the closest combination in terms of friendship – had been kept . apart, mainly by injuries and luck of the draw. 'I . haven't practised with him hardly at all, either,' said Murray. 'I will . actually be quite interested to play against him, to kind of see how is . game has changed and also the things I can do to make it difficult for . him, and there will be things that won't work against him, that `I'll . need to change as well. So it might be better for me to play against him . now rather than in the French or at Wimbledon.' Getting into gear: Murray cruised home after a troublesome first set . Blown it: Melzer faded after running Murray all the way in the first set . He . does not see huge signs of deterioration related to unexpected exits in . Monte Carlo and Barcelona over recent weeks: 'No, I think the thing is . the confidence. For example his forehand looks similar to me but it . looked like he was returning pretty short this week and when he is . confident he tends to return a lot deeper. 'He . has made some changes to his backhand during his career, so that might . be the shot that breaks down a little more but I don’t see major changes . in his game. Maybe he isn’t playing his best tennis at times, but he . looked pretty damn good last week. 'When . I was training for three or four weeks, some days the drills and . patterns of play were specific for Djokovic or Federer, and we would . also bring in some left handers, even if they play different to Rafa. I . could still work on the patterns of play that Ivan and myself felt would . work against him. The thing that is different about Rafa is the spin he . generates on his forehand, you can see the stats the amount of rotation . he puts on the ball is pretty incredible. Tough test: Murray will now face world No 1 Rafael Nadal in the last eight in Rome . In the past: Murray and Nadal (right) last played each other in the Japan Open final in October 2011 . 'That’s . the thing that takes time to get used to. The rest of his game is great . but he doesn’t serve like Ivanisevic, he doesn’t return like Agassi, . you always have an opportunity to dictate at some point against him.' Nadal . is also looking forward to the test: 'I have to go on the court and be . aggressive, and I need to play with a little bit more control. It will . be tough. It’s an important match for me because it’s against one of the . best players in the world after two tough days. 'I will need to take my chances. If I don’t I will be spending the weekend in Mallorca.' Murray . served well against Melzer and will look to replicate that and make his . opponent do plenty of running. An unlikely win would really park his . tank on Rafa’s lawn or, to be more accurate, his favourite rectangle of . dirt."}

PC Alan King met Zoe Barham after being called to a stabbing at the bookmakers where she worked in 2011. After collecting a witness statement and mobile number from her, the 48-year-old from Hoo, Kent, allegedly sent her text messages and the pair embarked on an affair. The father-of-two  picked Ms Barham up in his marked police car at least once every two weeks and had sex with her in an alleyway next to her house, Canterbury Crown Court heard. During the affair. he asked her if she 'needed' drugs then offered to drop charges against a suspect in exchange for cannabis he found after being the first officer at the scene of a stabbing, it was alleged. King denies misconduct in office, perverting the course of justice and supplying drugs. The court heard how the pair met in June 2011 when King was called to a reported stabbing at Betfred in Gravesend where Ms Barham, 36, worked. That week he visited the shop frequently and was even warned by a superior about his behaviour, the court heard. After collecting her phone number when she gave a witness statement, he sent a text message to the woman on her birthday and the pair began seeing each other. Over one year, the couple met in King's marked car and had sex in the vehicle in an alleyway next to her home while he was on duty, it was alleged. Rebecca Fairbairn, prosecuting, said: 'Alan King had a duty as a police officer to act beyond reproach, however we say he used a telephone number given as part of a police investigation and used it just because he was attracted to this woman.' 'He had an obligation to respond to emergencies and calls from the public, that’s what he is there to do. 'But we say that instead of doing that he was visiting his girlfriend and having sex, and on occasions doing it in public.' At first Ms Barham was unaware that King was married and had two children, she claims. 'We met in Forge Lane in Gravesend and he took me back to his home. 'I wasn’t aware about his relationship at first but I did suspect after a little while [he was married].' 'He would turn up in his marked police car and if I was at work we would just talk and have a fag. 'He would sometimes take me to my home in Gravesend in his police car. 'On one occasion he took me up an alley where we had sexual intercourse in his police car. That happened on several occasions. 'Mr King picked me up in his police car and took me there and he was in uniform. I went there because I was in a relationship with him. The married father-of-two denies misconduct in office, perverting the course of justice and supplying drugs after being accused of taking cannabis from a crime scene and smoking it with his lover . 'He promised me everything. He promised me a lot. He told me he loved me and I believed him at the time.' The 48-year-old took her along while investigating incidents and allowed her to input information into the vehicle's police computer, she added. While responding to a report of a man who had been stabbed in the neck, King allegedly seized cannabis from a suspect after being the first officer at the scene. He then gave the drug to Ms Barham after allegedly agreeing to drop all charges against the suspect, Martin Reid, in exchange for them. The affair ended when the the pair were arrested in relation an alleged fraud. Giving evidence on PC King claimed he was going through marriage difficulties and he was flattered when Ms Barham flirted with him. 'She was very friendly and was flirting with me. 'She made it very clear that she fancied me and its not very often a woman flirted with me...so I felt flattered and I flirted back.' PC King said they began their affair within a week and he admitted taking Ms Barham in his police car while attending non-emergency calls. Andrew Boughan, defending, asked: 'You would give Ms Barham lifts to and from her place of work in your marked police car?' The officer replied: 'That’s correct, maybe once a fortnight.' He denies taking cannabis from a crime scene, telling the jury: 'I hate drugs'. When asked why his former lover had made the allegations, he described her as a 'woman scorned'. The trial continues.

Samuel Tree, 68, had the devices made China before assembling them in his garden shed in Dunstable, Bedford, along with his wife, Joan, 62, who was given a suspended two year jail sentence. The couple were the final pair to be found guilty in a fraud case stretching back to 1999 which is thought to have netted a gang of con artists up to £80million. The crooks claimed the detectors could locate oil, drugs, and explosives up to three miles away, when in fact the devices were nothing more than empty plastic boxes filled with shredded paper. Samuel Tree, 68, has been jailed for three and a half years after being found guilty of selling fake the fake detectors, which his wife Joan, 62 (right) was given a suspended two year sentence . The couple claimed the detector, known as Alpha 6, could help find bombs, drugs, ivory and even missing people such as Madeleine McCann, while in fact it was an empty box filled with shredded paper . The device came with a label attached to it listing the item it was supposed to look for, and the Trees claimed it used the body's static electricity to power an aerial which would point to the object. Despite the 'Alice in Wonderland' science behind the device, known as Alpha 6, the Egyptian government placed an order worth £1million, while Thai officials paid £25,000 for a single unit. The device even duped Giles Paxman, brother of journalist Jeremy Paxman, who championed it while he was the UK's ambassador to Mexico. Units of Alpha 6 were bought by Saudi Arabia, India, Pakistan, China, and were also sold for use in the Green Zone in Iraq while British troops were serving there. Passing sentence on the Trees at Kingston Crown Court, Judge Richard Marks QC said: ‘You decided to market this device along with the other defendants previously convicted. ‘Thereafter you commissioned the device’s production in China, where the cost of an individual piece was just over £5. ‘You had the device stamped \"Made in Britain\", which in my view is plainly dishonest. ‘The device underwent various name changes over the years, but for all practical purposes it was the same thing. ‘The modest production cost is a reflection of the fact that this device was effectively a black plastic box, one similar to what might look like a small radio. The 'sensor' had a label on the front listing the item it was supposed to detect, and the Trees claimed the body's static electricity powered an antenna which would point towards the object being looked for . Despite the 'Alice in Wonderland' science behind the device, the gang of crooks that the Trees were part of managed to sell them to governments in Saudi Arabia, Thailand, China, Egypt, India and Pakistan . At Kingston Crown Court, Judge Richard Marks gave Joan Trees a suspended sentence after hearing that she would not have been involved in the scam if it weren't for her husband, but will likely still lose her house . ‘The way in which it worked was that a piece of card or paper would be attached to it, an image reflecting what it was proposed to be looking for. ‘The aerial would then point to the vicinity or direction of the person or object being searched for. ‘One only has to look at the bare facts to see this as a bizarre and fantastic proposition akin to something out of Alice in Wonderland. ‘This device was completely ineffectual. The basis on which it worked was a complete fantasy. ‘Even if you had not written line by line your own sales literature, the most customary glance at it would had put you on notice that all manner of scientific claims were mad. ‘That you decided not to sell the products in this country and not expose it to closer scrutiny, suggests a great deal about your motives.’ Fellow swindler Jim McCormick, 58, from Langport in Somerset was jailed for ten years last May after raking in £60million from the scam. Gary Bolton, also 58, from Chatham, Kentwas given seven years last August after making £45million, while Anthony Williamson, 59, from Gosport, Hampshire, was also convicted last May. Brendan Kelly QC, defending Samuel Tree, said: ’It is agreed that Mr Tree played a significant role in this offending, there can be no doubt argument about that. While the Trees sold the detector under the moniker Alpha 6 (far right, top) it was also sold in variations called XK9, GT200 and The Mole (pictured), which were all effectively the same product . The Alpha 6 model, which was sold by the Trees, consisted of a plastic box with an aerial attached, which would be filled with shredded paper, and cost just £5.10 to manufacture . The couple bought the items, which were falsely stamped 'Made in Britain', from China before selling them on for up to £25,000 to foreign governments . ‘Mr Tree is content for me to say on his behalf that the role played by Mrs Tree herself is substantially different to his. ‘I submit on his behalf that had it not been for him she would not have involved herself in this plot.’ Judge Marks added: ‘Financially this case will be disastrous for you because it will inevitably mean that you will lost all of your assets.’ The court heard that the Trees will likely lose their £180,000 house and £10,000 at a confiscation hearing set for 27 February 2015. Joan Tree was also ordered to carry out 300 hours of unpaid community work. Judge Marks QC concluded: ‘Joan Tree, you are in a significantly different situation to the one of your husband in my view. ‘It is undoubtedly the case that you played a significantly lesser role. ‘You were concerned with assisting your husband, not marketing or selling like him or in training. ‘You were, I am satisfied, acting under direction from your husband and would not have become involved in this situation had it not been for him. ‘I have given anxious consideration as to whether there is scope for suspending your sentence, and I have by the narrowest of margins decided that by this lesser role this is just possible. ‘You should consider yourself extremely fortunate as you have come as close to anyone to receiving a custodial sentence.’ The devices were even sold to Iraqi authorities while British troops were serving in the county . Detective constable Joanne Law, who led the investigation for the City of London Police, said: ‘Sam and Joan Tree were a couple driven by personal greed. They manufactured useless detectors which they knew were being marketed around the world as being able to locate anything from hidden explosives to missing persons. ‘The devices cost the couple only a few quid to make but were being sold on by agents for prices ranging from several thousand to half a million pounds, despite the fact they were nothing more than plastic boxes with a handle and antennae. ‘The sentencing of the Trees is the concluding act in a highly complex investigation into a global criminal network, which over a ten-year period turned-over up to £80 million. 'Thousands of false substance detectors were produced and sold putting both the users and the people they were bought to protect in grave danger. ‘The demise of these individuals sends a strong warning to anyone else who believes they can make criminal capital abroad while trading off the good name of British business.’"}
{"prompt": "A 34-year-old man being sought in a woman's death has been arrested in connection with the killings of two homeless men who were shot three days apart while both were sleeping on sidewalks, Atlanta police said Friday. Aeman Lovel Presley was in custody, but police weren't providing further details about his arrest, said Sgt. Greg Lyon. Presley, of Atlanta, also was wanted by police in Decatur, Georgia, in the fatal shooting Saturday night of a 44-year-old woman whose body was found behind an office building, according to police and CNN affiliate WSB. An arrest warrant for Presley was issued in the Decatur case, Decatur police Sgt. Jennifer Ross said Friday. \"We are actively working with multiple agencies at this time and cannot provide any further information that may jeopardize ongoing investigations,\" Ross said. Karen Pearce, a hair stylist in Marietta, was shot shortly after she left a restaurant in downtown Decatur, the affiliate reported. True Salon, where Pearce worked, said on its Facebook page Friday that \"while we are relieved to hear that a suspect is in custody, we are still trying to comprehend this senseless act of violence that took a very special person from our lives.\" Presley or his attorneys couldn't be immediately reached for comment Friday. Atlanta police called the shootings of homeless men \"sinister\" because whoever pulled the trigger wasn't expecting to gain from the victims monetarily. \"A lot of our shootings involve robbery. A lot of our shootings involve someone making good on an old debt or some kind of revenge factor,\" Atlanta police Detective David Quinn told reporters earlier this week. \"I don't know why someone would shoot two defenseless men.\" The shootings happened during Thanksgiving week, within three days of each other. Three days, 3 miles apart . In the homeless men case, the first shooting took place November 23. Dorian Jenkins, 42, was fatally shot five times as he slept, wrapped in a blanket, on a sidewalk in downtown Atlanta. Less than three days later, Tommy Mims, 64, didn't show up as normal at a recycling center where he took cans and other scrap metals to sell. Mims, known locally as \"Can Man\" was found dead under a bridge where he usually slept. His body, also wrapped in a blanket, had seven gunshot wounds. He was killed less than three miles from Jenkins. \"They never came out of the sleep they were already in,\" Quinn said. \"They weren't fleeing, running. They were asleep when they took these rounds.\" Telling details . Police say evidence links the killings of the homeless men. The rounds used in both shootings are fairly distinctive: .45-caliber bullets that, according to Quinn, haven't been made since 2010. They were fired from revolvers, either a Taurus \"Judge\" or a Smith & Wesson \"Governor.\" That reveals another troubling fact. \"These guns have a capacity of five or six rounds,\" Quinn said. But Mims, the second victim, had been shot seven times. \"Someone had to reload the gun in order to get seven rounds in him.\""}
{"prompt": "(CNN) -- Doctors Without Borders has embarked on a massive vaccination campaign in three African countries to combat an outbreak of meningitis that has killed hundreds of people, the organization said Wednesday. A child gets vaccinated against meningitis in Niger in August 2007. The vaccinations are being carried out in Niger, Nigeria, and Chad -- part of a large swath of what is known as the \"meningitis belt\" of sub-Saharan Africa, the organization said. The \"belt\" stretches from Senegal to Ethiopia. Doctors Without Borders, widely known by its French name, Medecins Sans Frontieres, said medical teams have treated and vaccinated 5.4 million people and plan on vaccinating another 1.7 million -- making the vaccination campaign the organization's largest ever. The group said more than 1,900 people have died in this outbreak since January. More than 56,000 cases have been reported in Nigeria, Niger and Chad alone, the organization said. Last month, the World Health Organization said the disease was at epidemic level in 76 areas of in Niger and Nigeria, and a spokesman in Nigeria, Dr. Olaokun Soyinka, said the outbreak was \"bigger than usual.\" In March, the organization said a total of 24,868 suspected cases had been reported in the \"meningitis belt,\" including 1,513 deaths. The outbreak began around the start of the year, Soyinka told CNN. It usually peaks in the dry season because of dust, winds and cold nights, before dipping around May when the rains come, he said. Meningitis is an infection of the meninges, the thin lining that surrounds the brain and the spinal cord, according to the World Health Organization. Several different bacteria can cause meningitis but Neisseria meningitidis -- which is to blame for the current outbreak -- is one of the most important because of its potential to cause epidemics."}
{"prompt": "Finally, after 22 minutes inside the Sun Life Stadium, the combination of Wayne Rooney and Daniel Sturridge crackled into life. Sadly, after a lightning storm interrupted England’s final friendly before the World Cup, we only ever got to see flashes of the pairing’s potential. On Saturday evening, when England face Italy in the opening group game of the World Cup in Manaus, it will have to come together. Room for improvement: Daniel Sturridge (left) failed to find the back of the net against Honduras . Going for goal: Wayne Rooney (left) bends a free-kick towards goal during the first half . Rooney was substituted at half-time on Saturday night, but the duo will still be paired against Italy. Rooney and Sturridge haven’t played nearly enough football together and this was the last chance before the team flew overnight to their Rio de Janeiro training base. Sturridge really should have scored when Danny Welbeck and Rooney broke through the Honduras defence midway through the first half. The Liverpool striker, who turned neatly inside the penalty area, skewed his shot wide of the target. Sturridge has scored four times for his country and will know that he could have easily added another. It will come and he doesn’t care who his partner is. He’s in top form, flush full of confidence after scoring 21 goals for Liverpool in the Barclays Premier League. There is a maturity about his game — he is a willing team player in Hodgson’s disciplined and organised 4-2-3-1 formation. It feels as though he is England’s main goal threat — the most likely to change a game in the same way that Gary Lineker did in his country’s colours. Frustrated figure: Sturridge kicks out at a post after a save from Honduras goalkeeper Noel Valladares (left) Dejected: Rooney trudges off the pitch after England's disappointing 0-0 draw with Honduras . There were bursts from Rooney, too, after England’s head coach restored him to his favoured position for this final work-out. The Manchester United striker is the only player to start all three friendlies ahead of the World Cup. He didn’t finish this one, however, and was replaced by the livewire Ross Barkley for the second period. Next week, Rooney must turn it on in tournament football. That was his promise in Portugal when he arrived in Vale do Lobo a full week ahead of schedule to make sure that he was in shape this summer. He owes England at a World Cup, particularly after his subdued performances in 2006 and 2010. This is his chance. Missed opportunities: Sturridge (left) missed trio of good chances at the Sun Life Stadium in Miami . Pressure: Rooney (left) has failed to score a World Cup goal for England despite making the squad in 2006 and 2010 . It has been a difficult week for Hodgson to prepare his team, particularly after they were forced to abandon their training session at Barry University last Monday. They were forced into a campus gym because of the hurricane season and on Saturday, with the score 0-0, the teams had to leave the field of play. England were well aware of the risks when they booked their week-long stay in Miami and went ahead with the plan. Hodgson remains convinced that his squad are ready for the challenges ahead when they arrive at base camp in Rio. What they will need now is some positive forward thinking."}
{"prompt": "Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert has said Southampton counterpart Ronald Koeman has behaved in an unacceptable manner by trying to unsettle his Dutch World Cup semi-final defender Ron Vlaar. Vlaar came through his first pre-season friendly by playing the second 45 minutes in yesterday’s 0-0 draw with Parma after taking a break after his impressive tournament displays in Brazil. Lambert is keen to open talks with the 29-year-old centre-half once the transfer window shuts but has been appalled by Koeman saying publicly Vlaar ‘would definitely be an option’ for Southampton after selling Dejan Lovren to Liverpool. Hot property: Ron Vlaar 'would definitely be an option' for Southampton but Villa want him to stay . Spat: The season hasn't even begun and Paul Lambert is already kicking off with Ronald Koeman . Koeman used to manage Vlaar at Dutch club Feyenoord but Lambert hit out at his comments saying; ‘There is been absolutely no enquiry, not one iota on it. The only thing I am disappointed in is people talking about him, who should know better than to talk about other people’s players. ‘I don’t think you accept it. I think out of respect you don’t do it, you don’t get involved in that. That is my opinion. You will have to ask others what they think but I am just giving my opinion.’ Vlaar’s appearance gave Villa fans a welcome boost and Lambert expects him to be at the club come September 1. ‘He’s only been back in training over a week really. For him to play against Parma was good, he was able to cruise the game so it wasn’t too much of a strain for him. ‘He (Vlaar) had a great World Cup. In the games he had, he was excellent, up against quality players in every one of them. I am expecting Ron to have a good season.’ Vlaar only has a year left on his contract but Lambert hopes formal talks will start soon. ‘Ron has been really good about it, he’s never really pushed anything. Once it settles down, I am pretty sure we will talk.’ Impressive: Vlaar (right) was part of a solid Dutch defence at the World Cup and has attracted interest . Villa need a tight defence this season because on yesterday’s evidence, they lack firepower going into the new campaign. After recent defeats against Chesterfield and Groningen, a dour draw with Parma was an improvement with the mean Italians marshalled by ex-Liverpool World Cup defender Gabriel Paletta. Even so, there was little to get Villa fans queuing around the block for season tickets with current sales well down on the 28,000 of last season. Things only livened up at the end when 18-year-old Jack Grealish came on and started running the show. It was lay-back for Darren Bent that produced the best chance in injury-time but Bent hit the crossbar from close-range. ‘I will be disappointed if he (Grealish) isn’t pushing for a place this season,’ said Lambert, once a top midfield player himself. Extended holiday: Vlaar is only just getting back to work at Villa after a World Cup-enforced break ."}

Britain could take back powers from the European Union covering immigration, tourism, benefits and trade, it emerged today. Ministers revealed the latest shopping list of policy areas which could be returned from Brussels as part of David Cameron’s plan to negotiate a new EU deal before holding an in-out vote. It includes suggesting that tighter immigration controls are need to maintain public confidence in the welfare state and questioning whether EU trade policy deters investment in the UK. David Cameron has insisted he wants Britain to remain in the EU, but only if his review and renegotiation secures a better deal with Brussels . The Prime Minister set up the Balance of Competences Review to examine which EU rules Britain should consider withdrawing from. After taking evidence from a wide range of pro- and anti-European bodies and experts, the government hopes to use it as proof that many edicts from Brussels are not working. However has been largely dismissed by other EU countries, raising doubts about what concessions – if any – Mr Cameron will be able to secure. Mr Cameron wants the review to ‘give everyone the opportunity to make their points about which areas of European endeavour are in our interest and which are not’. The latest stage plank of his Europe strategy comes after a tumultuous week for the Prime Minister, who last night saw 114 Tory MPs condemn him for not including an EU referendum in the Queen's Speech. Today Tory MP James Wharton won the backbench draw to take legislation through Parliament, and vowed to try to enshrine an in-out vote into law. It came as the Home Office, HM Treasury, Ministry of Justice, Department for Business and Department for Culture, Media and Sport issued a call for evidence on areas of policy and its impact on the UK. They cover the free movement of goods and people, asylum and immigration, family law. One of the most contentious areas has been access to benefits for newcomers to Britain. A raft of EU rules are to be reviewed by the UK government to see if they benefit Britain or hold back growth . The Home Office review published today states that access to social security benefits for people from outside the UK is ‘inevitably a controversial matter’. The government used the Queen’s Speech to promise tougher curbs on access to housing, out-of-work benefits and healthcare, but ministers admit they are hamstrung by some EU rules. The Home Office highlights in its review fears that allowing people to move around the EU could be having a ‘disproportionate impact on the social security systems of some member states’. Immigration minister Mark Harper said: ‘The result of the reports will be a comprehensive, thorough and detailed analysis of the balance of competences between the EU and the UK on the issues of asylum and immigration, and free movement of persons. ‘It will aid our understanding of the nature of our EU membership and it will provide a constructive and serious contribution to the wider European debate about modernising, reforming and improving the EU.’ Immigration minister Mark Harper said the review would pinpoint ways to 'modernise and improve' the EU  French President Francois Hollande has ruled out allowing Britain to renegotiate its membership . The review of family law includes the powers to resolve disputes where a parent takes a child to another part of the EU without the other parent’s consent. It also covers claiming maintenance payments from estranged fathers who move to a different member state. The culture review questions the effectiveness of heritage programmes masterminded by Brussels and whether the involvement of the EU in tourism policy makes it harder for countries to compete for visitors. Trade experts are asked by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills about the benefits of EU’s trade policy benefits and whether Britain  succeeds in curbing the protectionist instincts of other member states. However French President Francois Hollande has made clear he will not allow Britain to renegotiate new membership terms. ‘To repatriate [powers]? Usually when a country commits, it is for life,’ he said last year. ‘I believe that treaties are meant to be complied with. This discussion could take place, but Europe is not a Europe in which you can take back competences. It is not Europe à la carte.’"}
{"prompt": "By . Robin Cottle for MailOnline . Former Arsenal striker Kevin Campbell doesn't think Alexis Sanchez is the man to fire the Gunners to title glory. The Chilean forward arrived in a £30 million deal from Barcelona this summer and boss Arsene Wenger hopes he's the man to help end a 10-year Premier League title drought. But speaking to the Weekend Sports Breakfast on talkSPORT, Campbell claims Wenger hasn't addressed the deficiencies in his squad - namely a reliable goalscorer and midfield powerhouse. Leading the line: Kevin Campbell doubts whether Alexis Sanchez will solve Arsenal's problems . He said: 'Alexis Sanchez is a fantastic signing but I don't think the problems have really been addressed. 'I like the Calum Chambers signing but he's going to take a bit of time to bed in. The two main problems were the centre of the pitch and a noted goalscorer and they haven't addressed that problem. 'If you struggled against the top boys and you don't address the problems, then you can't expect a different result in my opinion.' As well as Sanchez, Wenger has brought in Chambers in for £12 million from Southampton and French defender Mathieu Debuchy arrived for £10 million from Newcastle. Big ambitions: Sanchez (right) and team-mates Mikel Arteta and Mathieu Flamini will be hoping to prove Campbell wrong this season . On the ball: Sanchez (right) takes on Yannick Bolasie on his Premier League debut . New kid on the block: Sanchez is expected to be a key player for Arsenal this season as they chase glory . But attempts to sign World Cup winning Real Madrid midfielder Sami Khedira has failed and Campbell, who also played for Everton and Nottingham Forest, said the Gunners are still short in the middle of the park. And Campbell questions whether the former Barcelona man, who scored 21 goals in all competitions for the Catalans last season, has the physical attributes to lead the line in English football. He said: 'Coming from Barcelona is different to playing in the Premier League. 'Sanchez is going to get a lot more physical pressure against him, so I don't see him as being a centre forward who can take the hits. 'I don't see him being that central striker.' Arsenal verdict: Kevin Campbell takes on Oldham during his time with the Gunners and will follow his former club keenly this season . Campbell scored 59 goals in 228 games for the Gunners from 1988 until leaving for Nottingham Forest in 1995. Sanchez played the full 90 minutes as Arsenal beat Crystal Palace 2-1 on the opening day of the Premier League season."}

Tools of the trade: He used a lamp in the entryway to break the glass doors . Break-in: A disgruntled man broke into a Topeka news station Wednesday morning and stabbed two of its employees . Teamwork: Station employees managed to hold Miles down until police arrived at the scene . The suspect, who police identified as Ray Miles, and two people who were stabbed were taken to a nearby hospital for treatment. None of their injuries were considered serious. The station reported that the melee started after the man spoke to news director Jon Janes on a lobby phone, saying the Department of Veterans Affairs was mishandling his case. When Mr Janes explained that the man needed to discuss the issue with the VA, the man stormed out of the building. However, he returned about 10 minutes later and threw a lamp through the glass front doors, shattering them. The suspect was later identified as homeless man Ray Miles . Security footage from the news station shows Miles opening the door through the broken glass then walking into the building. Mr Janes told the receptionist to tell other employees to leave the front office area. The station said some employees left as the man ran through the halls. Some employees managed to tackle Miles, and that’s when he allegedly pulled out a knife and stabbed sales manager Roger Brokke and sales associate Greg Palmer. Both were knifed in the leg, and Miles bit Mr Brokke on the ear as well. After the receptionist had alerted the staff of the intruder, Master Control Operator Joe Garrett called 911 and witnessed the takedown via security camera.

The pictures show dozens of mangled, emaciated corpses of men who were starved, strangled, shot, beaten and tortured to death at the hands agents working for the Syrian president. One veteran civil rights prosecutor said the pictures document 'an industrial killing machine not seen since the Holocaust,' Yahoo News reports. Stephen Rapp, the US ambassador-at-large for war crimes, told Yahoo that the photos are 'some of the strongest evidence we've seen in the area of proof of the commission of mass atrocities.' WARNING: EXTREMELY GRAPHIC CONTENT . Never again: The US Holocaust Museum is putting a selection of photos from the Syrian massacre on display . These pictures of men who had been tortured to death were taken by 'Caesar,' a former Syrian government photographer who defected and handed over a trove of 27,000 pictures to investigators . The images are part of a cache of 27,000 pictures that were smuggled out of Syria by 'Caesar,' a photographer with the Syrian military police who defected after documenting the brutality of al-Assad's regime. 'Caesar,' who is currently in hiding in Europe, was tasked with documenting deaths in government custody by the Syrian military. His pictures show unimaginable horror. Eyes gouged out. Hands bound. Bodies so emaciated from starvation that ribs poke through the skin. Men who died from being stabbed, strangled, shot or beaten. An estimated 100,000 civilians have been killed since the Syrian people rose up against Assad, who has ruled the country with an iron fist since taking power from his father in 2000. Before the country broke into all-out civil war, the Assad regime's secret police and military abducted many thousands of protesters and tortured them to death. The pictures show that these men died from grotesque torture and abuse. Caesar has testified that they died as captives of the Syrian government . Over 100,000 civilians have been killed since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad. Assad has ordered brutal crackdowns since the movement began . David Crane, a former war crime prosecutor who worked in Sierra Leone and interviewed 'Caesar,' compared the atrocities in Syria to those committed by the Nazi in the Holocaust. US Congressman Ed Royce, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called Caesar to testify in front of his committee in July. He made the same grim comparison, telling Yahoo News: 'my father had taken photos at Dachau when it was liberated, of the bodies stacked up at the ovens. This is eerily reminiscent. It's absolutely appalling.' The Holocaust Museum, which is in Washington, DC, has previously spoken out about the unspeakable human rights violations in Syria. In February, the museum sent a delegation of observers to Jordan to record the horror conditions faced by refugees fleeing war-torn Syria."}
{"prompt": "Parents: Kate and Gerry McCann were hurt by a controversial book about Madeleine, a judge ruled . The former police chief who published astonishing claims that Kate and Gerry McCann faked their daughter Madeleine’s disappearance to cover up her death expects them to lose their libel battle against him, it was claimed today. Goncalo Amaral is reported to have said the early rulings by the judge in the  case suggested her verdict may be 'favourable' to him. The 57-year-old told Portuguese television on Friday that Maria Emilia Melo e Castro’s indications so far led him to believe he would win the case, according to the Daily Star. His comments came as a ruling emerged that the McCanns were hurt by the book written by Mr Amaral, who was tasked with finding the girl. But the pain the couple feel existed before Mr Amaral published the controversial claims, Mrs Melo e Castro said. The finding came out of a key hearing on Wednesday in Lisbon ahead of a final judgement in the long-running £1million libel trial which has pitted the McCanns against the disgraced former detective they accuse of hampering the search for their daughter. The judge presiding over the high-profile case ruled on 37 points she found had been proven and not proven since lawyers started their court battle in October 2013. She said statements made by Mr Amaral in his July 2008 book The Truth of The Lie and a subsequent TV documentary and Portuguese newspaper interview had left the McCanns suffering ‘rage, desperation, anguish, worry, insomnia and lack of appetite’. But she ruled that although the book had affected the couple, those feelings pre-existed the book’s publication three days after the first Portuguese investigation into Madeleine’s disappearance was shelved and the McCanns were told they were no longer ‘arguidos’ (formal suspects). Scroll down for video . Former police chief: The judge said statements made by Goncalo Amaral in his  book The Truth of The Lie and a subsequent TV documentary and Portuguese newspaper interview had left the McCanns suffering 'rage' Mrs Melo e Castro also ruled it had not been proven Kate and Gerry, from Rothley, Leicestershire, were ‘completely destroyed, from a moral, social, ethical, sentimental and family perspective beyond the pain their daughter’s absence causes them’ by statements made in Amaral’s book. She also decided it had been proven the couple felt badly about being considered responsible for hiding their daughter’s body - a thesis which Portuguese police behind a new probe into Madeleine’s disappearance have publicly rubbished - but described those feelings as ‘expectable.’ But she dismissed the idea Mr Amaral’s claims about the McCanns had stopped the Portuguese police investigating Madeleine’s disappearance. Still missing: Portuguese prosecutors reopened their probe into Madeleine’s disappearance last year . The rulings left Mr Amaral confident of court victory next month when the judge is expected to announce her final verdict in open court before releasing her sentence in writing. He accused the McCanns of taking him to court so they could exonerate themselves of blame for the disappearance of their daughter, who vanished aged three from their Praia da Luz holiday flat in May 2007 while they were eating tapas nearby with friends. Portuguese papers signalled the outcome of last Wednesday’s hearing as a positive one for heart specialist Gerry and Kate moments after it finished. But as the full findings became apparent they changed their tune to portray the judge’s rulings as a slap in the face for the couple. Leading Portuguese daily Correio da Manha headlined an article on the result of the hearing: ‘McCanns destroyed before the book.’ Rival Jornal de Noticias reported: ‘Judge without proof that the book about Maddie \"destroyed\" her parents.’ The McCanns told the Lisbon court staging the Amaral libel trial last summer they were left ‘devastated and crushed’ by his book, which sold around 120,000 copies before it was withdrawn when the British couple won an injunction against the ex-police chief. Mrs McCann, 47, said Madeleine’s twin siblings Sean and Amelie, now ten, knew Mr Amaral had written a book but didn’t know the detail. Legal case: The rulings left Mr Amaral (pictured) confident of court victory next month when as expected the judge announces her final verdict in open court before releasing her sentence in writing . She told the court last July after applying to make a statement: ‘I believe that’s what's in Mr Amaral’s book and the documentary is very distressing to adults. To a child it could be very damaging.’ Asked by the judge how she felt after reading the book, she said: ‘I was devastated. It made me feel quite desperate because of the injustice I felt towards my daughter and our family as a whole. ‘It was very painful to read and I felt sad for Madeleine. I also felt anxious and fearful because of the damage I felt it was doing in Portugal.’ She went on to accuse Mr Amaral, thrown off the Madeleine McCann investigation in 2007 for criticising British police, of ‘consistently smearing’ she and Gerry - and claimed they feared the book may have stopped people coming forward with information about their daughter’s whereabouts. It has already been revealed Mr Amaral, 56, earned at least £344,000 from his book and TV documentary. The ex-police chief, who is being sued for £1million, is denying defamation. Case: Mr and Mrs McCann arrive for the libel case against Mr Amaral at Lisbon's Palace of Justice last June . His lawyer Miguel Cruz Rodrigues claimed in the last open court hearing in December the McCanns had taken legal action against his client ‘to rid themselves of guilt for their negligent conduct’ in leaving Madeleine and her siblings alone. He also claimed their lack of cooperation with the Portuguese police authorities had led to the archiving of the investigation in 2008. Portuguese prosecutors reopened their probe into Madeleine’s disappearance last year and are conducting a separate investigation to one led by Scotland Yard. No date has been set yet for the final judgement in the libel case. The judgement will be read out in court before being released in writing on the same day. A source close to the McCanns said last night: ‘We expect it to be ready for next month.’"}
{"prompt": "A federal judge on Friday ruled that Michigan's prohibition on same-sex marriage violates the U.S. Constitution, ordering the state to stop enforcing the ban. \"Today's decision ... affirms the enduring principle that regardless of whoever finds favor in the eyes of the most recent majority, the guarantee of equal protection must prevail,\" U.S. District Judge Bernard Friedman wrote. Michigan is the latest state in which federal judges have struck down state constitutional bans on gay marriage. Similar rulings recently have been issued in Texas, Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma and Utah, though in those cases judges have put off enforcement of the decisions until higher courts can weigh in. Friday's decision is different in that it opens the door for same-sex couples to get marriage licenses in Michigan very soon. Barb Byrum, the elected county clerk for Ingham County and a Democrat, said she is eager and ready to do so once her office opens at 8 a.m. Monday. \"This is a wonderful decision,\" Byrum said. \"Many Michiganders have been waiting for equality in our great state, and I look forward to the opportunity to issue marriage licenses to all loving couples.\" That day may not come so fast. Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette, a Republican whose term expires later this year, announced Friday evening he's filed an emergency request for Friedman's order to be stayed and appealed. \"In 2004, the citizens of Michigan recognized that diversity in parenting is best for kids and families because moms and dads are not interchangeable,\" Schuette said. \"Michigan voters enshrined that decision in our state constitution, and their will should stand and be respected.\" He was referring to the year that voters in Michigan, along with those in 10 other states, passed state constitutional amendments restricting \"marriage or (a) similar union\" to between one man and one woman. Whether same-sex couples should be allowed to wed was a hot-button issue then and in subsequent years, with polls showing that most Americans favored restrictions. But public opinion shifted over time. An ABC News/Washington Post survey released earlier this month found that 59% of Americans favor allowing gay or lesbian couples to legally wed. Michigan's amendment, specifically, states the rationale for its restrictions is \"to secure and preserve the benefits of marriage for our society and for future generations of children.\" Friedman -- like federal judges in other recent, similar cases -- ruled Michigan's ban violates the Equal Protection Clause  in the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment. He said, \"The court finds the (Michigan Marriage Amendment) impermissibly discriminates against same-sex couples in violation of the Equal Protection Clause because the provision does not advance any conceivable state interest.\" The plaintiffs in the Michigan case, April DeBoer and Jayne Rowse, sued in part because Michigan law also \"restricts adoptions to either single persons or married couples.\" They had hoped to jointly adopt three children under their care. Friday's ruling, then, would seem to open the door to same-sex couples jointly adopting children, since now they could be legally married. In the ruling, Friedman cited  the Supreme Court's landmark decisions last June rejecting parts of the Defense of Marriage Act while ruling same-sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits. The justices didn't go as far as saying that all states must allow such marriages to take place within their borders, but a number of lower federal courts did subsequently step into the fray. In addition to United States v. Windsor, Friedman also pointed to Loving v. Virginia -- in which the Supreme Court ruled that Virginia's ban on interracial marriages was unconstitutional. \"Both the Windsor and Loving decisions stand for the proposition that, without some overriding legitimate interest, the state cannot use its domestic relations authority to legislate families out of existence,\" the judge wrote. Keeping their own family together is and was DeBoer and Rowse's No. 1 goal, they said. \"Jayne and I do want to get married, but this case is about the protection of our children,\" a joyful DeBoer said. \"It is not about individuals, it is not about her or my relationship. It is about ensuring that our children will remain together no matter what happens to her and I.\""}
{"prompt": "By . Lucy Waterlow . Children who grew up with parents addicted to drink and drugs have revealed the terrifying toll it took on their childhood. While their homes should have been a place of safety and refuge, for Leanne and John (not their real names) they were associated with fear. Her situation due to her often drunk single mother became so bad that Leanne, from London, ran away from home at the age of just 11. Volatile: Leanne was so scared of her mother when she'd had a drink, she ran away age 11 preferring to sleep rough than be at home (pictures posed by models) She told MailOnline: 'I never knew my dad and I was an . only child. My mum and I led a very chaotic lifestyle: one year we lived in 12 . different places. The houses were all in bad condition and always dirty. 'My . relationship with my mum wasn't good. She'd had two or three partners who she had turbulent . relationships with. There were loads of rows, sometimes violent ones late into the night. Things were smashed and at the weekend she would . drink heavily. 'I was frightened of her when she was drunk as she was . very unpredictable. I was really stressed and not sleeping. I felt . isolated. There was no-one to turn to, only my mum, and that wasn't . working. It all got too much for me, I was utterly miserable, so I ran . away from home. I was an 11-year-old girl wandering around by myself at night and I was scared.' She added: 'It was freezing and I was terrified that someone would hurt me. But frightened as I was, I couldn't face going home.' It was thanks to Childline that she didn't have to sleep rough. They tried to help her reestablish a relationship with her mother but when that failed, they found her a refuge and then a foster home to stay in till she was 16. ...At school I'd hear people talk about the fun things they did with their parents and I'd think \"why can't I have that?\" She said: Through all those difficult years . ChildLine was there for me. If they hadn't helped me when I ran away and . I was alone in the park overnight I shudder to think what could have . happened to me. 'Whenever things got really bad, I called them and they . helped me through it. ChildLine always listened to me and believed what I . said and having my counsellor at the end of the phone made me feel as . though I mattered and there was always someone there for me. I really . don't know what I would have done without ChildLine.' Meanwhile, John's experience growing up with a drug addict father is equally heartbreaking. John, from Grimsby, who is now 18, said: 'I . knew from a young age that my life was different to other children. I'd see my . dad fall over or just be asleep on the sofa by 6pm. I used to think \"why is he . falling asleep, he's done nothing all day so why is he tired?\" I'd sit next to . him and clap or make another noise, anything just to try and keep him awake as . I knew something wasn't right. 'We . always used to have lots of people in the house too. They'd arrive at weird times like 2am or 6am . and they'd be really noisy. My dad had told me that my mother was in prison for . drugs and I slowly began to realise as I got older that he was a drug user too.' John said as a result of his father's problem, he lived in squalor and fear. But it was only when he went to a school friend's house that he realise how different his life was to his peers. Concern: ChildLine carried out 5,323 counselling sessions with children worried about their parents' abuse of drink or drugs - up from 2,509 the previous year . He said: 'I remember going to a friend's house and his family all sat up to be table for the meal and I thought \"what are they doing?\" I wasn't used to being in a family environment and spending time with family. 'At home our lives were very separate as I'd spend a lot of time in my room to get away from my dad and his friends who were taking drugs downstairs. He would never come and tuck me in, instead he'd pass out on the sofa. He added: 'When I went to friends' houses I realised that they had more things than me, like playstations and mobiles, and I didn't understand why I couldn't have them. I felt lost and lonely. 'At school I'd hear people talk about the fun things they did with their parents and I'd think \"why can't I have that?\" There was only a couple of friends who I trusted that came inside my house as I didn't want others to see what state it was in. Some of their parents wouldn't let me them come round as they knew my dad was doing drugs.' John recalls one particularly horrific experience. 'When I was about nine, a man overdosed in my house. I remember walking upstairs and seeing him on the floor in our bathroom next to some heroin and a needle covered in blood. I didn't know what to do and I was scared but my dad just told me to go to my room,' he said. It was shortly after this that he found salvation via Childline. He was referred to the NSPCC's FEDUP programme which does group work with children whose parents have drug or alcohol problems. He said: 'I was a bit nervous the first time I went as I knew why I was there but I didn't know what to expect. I loved it straight away as it helped me to realise that I wasn't the only person in that situation - other young people were going through the same thing.' Leanne and John have shared her story after figures released today by Childline have shown a shock rise in the number of children contacting them about their parents' drinking and drug-taking. The number of children counselled by ChildLine because their parents were drinking too much - or taking drugs - has more than doubled last year, averaging 15 counselling sessions a day to the free, 24-hour helpline. ChildLine carried out 5,323 counselling sessions with children worried about their parents' abuse of drink or drugs - up from 2,509 the previous year. ...When I was about nine, a man overdosed . in my house. I remember walking upstairs and seeing him on the floor in . our bathroom next to some heroin and a needle covered in blood . Most of the children counselled were 12 to 15 years old, although one in 10 were of primary school age. The figures contrast with a long-term fall in violent crime in England and Wales, thought to be partially influenced by the rising cost of alcohol. The charity said further research is needed to explain the sudden increase but it would appear that more children are witnessing drunken behaviour and experiencing violence at home, or they are more aware that help is available. Many children told ChildLine that they lived in fear of their parents' anger, with one in six saying they'd been physically hurt by their mother or father when they were under the influence. Some reported living in dirty and even dangerous surroundings, lacking essentials because money was frittered on alcohol or drugs. Children spoke of feeling helpless and not knowing where to go for support. Shock rise: More children are witnessing drunken behaviour and experiencing violence at home according to statistics from Childline (posed by models) Sue Minto, Head of ChildLine, said: 'These shocking ChildLine statistics are sadly only one small piece of the jigsaw. Official estimates are that more than 250,000 children in the UK have parents with drug problems, and three in 10 children live with at least one binge-drinking parent. 'It's heart-breaking that so many young people struggle alone because they do not know where to go for help or are unsure of what might happen if they speak to someone. They may fear being taken away from their families by social services and put into care and believe that they are protecting their family by keeping quiet. 'Some children tell us their parents are under stress and it may be that they are using drink and drugs to blot out worries about jobs, money or housing issues. But whatever the reasons behind the rise, it's vital that anyone who knows a parent with drink or drug problems takes action to get that family help so that their children are protected.' John said the support of the charity was invaluable to him. He explained: 'It was good to have the NSPCC in my life as they provided me with a consistency that was missing at home and gave me someone to talk to. 'Going there made me want to help other people and I started to help deliver the FEDUP sessions to other young people. I’m also going to university to do a social worker degree.' Children can seek help by contacting ChildLine on 0800 1111 or at childline.org.uk. Adults with concerns about a child should call the NSPCC helpline on 0808 800 5000."}
{"prompt": "By . Craig Mackenzie . PUBLISHED: . 05:57 EST, 7 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:22 EST, 8 July 2013 . As 12 million British hayfever sufferers struggle with the worst season for years, they are turning to private clinics for a 'wonder-cure' jab the NHS no longer offers because it is too 'toxic'. Internet forums have been swamped by people fuming at not being able to get the injections from their GPs. For many years, kenalog jabs were prescribed to those with the most severe symptoms, but they were withdrawn when it was realised they left patients at greater risk from contagious illnesses. Suffering: People with hayfever are turning to private clinics who inject patients with a powerful drug which the NHS has rejected as 'toxic' The injection contains the drug . triamcinolone, a corticosteroid that suppresses the body's immune system . to prevent allergic reactions to pollen. But it leaves the body open to infections such as chicken pox and measles, for three weeks after being administered. Other potential side effects include bone . pain, easy bruising and bleeding, severe stomach and abdominal pain, . shortness of breath and irregular heartbeats. The 50mg or 100mg doses are 10 or 20 times stronger than the oral steroid tablets now offered on the NHS. In tablet form the steroid can be regulated for its effect on the body. Keeping the pollen at bay: A sufferer wears a mask in a field of rape seed. Jabs have been withdrawn by GPs . By suppressing the immune system, kenalog also leaves people unable to cope with serious illness or the trauma caused by an accident or sudden shock, for example being in a car crash. Many of those posting on the internet believe the kenalog jabs have been withdrawn as a cost-cutting measure, but doctors fear the public simply does not realise how harmful this powerful drug can be. Desperate: There are 12 million people with hayfever in Britain who are suffering in the worst season for years . Dr James Cave, who  edits the Drugs . And Therapeutic Bulletin, said: 'Let's be clear, it's incredibly . effective but just as you can light a barbecue with petrol, you can . treat hayfever with kenalog, and I seriously suggest you don't because . of the dangers associated with it. 'Kenalog does not have a place in treating hayfever, due to its significant side effects. 'For . three weeks after having the injection your immune system is . suppressed, which means you are seriously at risk of infections like . chicken pox and measles. 'Likewise . if you have a serious illness or a road traffic accident, you may not . be able to cope with the stress, with kenalog suppressing your own . stress reactions.' Dr Cave said oral steroid tablets when . needed, combined with daily antihistamine tablets, nasal sprays and eye . drops, work for most sufferers. This combination could be needed during the heatwave forecast for the rest of July. Dr Margaret McCartney, a GP from Glasgow, added: 'This is not a drug that is suitable for hayfever, because its side effects outweigh dramatically any possible benefits. 'You can get the benefits in far less toxic ways.' Beverley Adams-Groom, from the National Pollen and Aerobiology Research Unit, warned that the pollen count will return to 'very high' for the next two weeks. She said: 'The good news is that the better the weather during the main flowering season, the shorter the season will be, as the grasses become exhausted of pollen under continuing favourable conditions. 'The bad news is that very high counts mean greater symptoms for sufferers and a higher number of people are affected. 'We are now about halfway through the main grass pollen season. 'Fine weather forecast for much of July in the South means that the season should be over before the end of the month. 'In the northern regions, the weather outlook is not so good and this will extend the season a little into August, although there will be a mixture of risk over that time period.'"}
{"prompt": "Northern Tanzania (CNN) -- One could classify the Hadza people as a throwback. Numbering a mere 1,300, they represent one of the last communities of hunter-gatherers in the world. Their language -- which includes click consonants -- is unrelated to any other on Earth, and is possibly one of the oldest spoken languages in existence. Their DNA, too, suggests an ancient heritage, easily 100,000 years old (and possibly a primary root for mankind's family tree). Their home, near Northern Tanzania's Olduvai Gorge, has been dubbed the \"Cradle of Mankind,\" partly because it has unearthed some of the oldest known human remains. An ancient way of life . Many of the Hadza live in a remote stretch of Tanzania, where much of their day is given over to foraging and hunting. The techniques they use for finding sustenance are passed down generation to generation. The men favor handmade bows and arrows, while the women dig up roots and gather berries. The Hadza don't store food, plant trees or build houses. Rather, they make temporary huts from dried grass and intertwined branches, and move in accordance with the local animals. \"We are rich in tradition,\" explains Shani Msafin-Sigwaze, the first Hadza to attend university, and an informal spokesperson for his community. \"Culture is very important, because when people forget their culture, they forget where they are from,\" he adds. Mounting challenges . Unfortunately, the Hadza way of life is under threat. In the last 50 years, they have lost 90% of their land to farmers and cattle herders, according to Survival International, an NGO in defense of tribal people around the world. \"Without the land, the Hadza will disappear,\" warns Msafin-Sigwaze. Furthermore, a lot of the big game animals and local plants that traditionally have made up the bulk of the Hadza diet are disappearing. \"There is a big problem with cows,\" admits Msafin-Sigwaze. \"The animals are scared of them and they run away. That's why the hunters have to [travel] far to even find little birds.\" Meanwhile, much of the local forest and bush has been burned to make way for crops, or has been razed to produce water holes for irrigation. \"The Hadza are suffering much because the natural food is disappearing,\" explains Msafin-Sigwaze. Positive signs? Though the threat the Hadza face is real -- and extinction is far from a remote possibility -- there have been some successful efforts to restore some of what they've lost. In 2011, for instance, the Tanzanian government issued land titles to a community of Hadza living in Yaeda Chini. Now Msafin-Sigwaze, who belongs to a separate tribe of Hadza, is hoping he can achieve the same for his community. \"I belong to the Hadza. I study in the name of the Hadza. The name of the Hadza has made me go to university,\" he says. \"Now, I'm going to fight until I see the Hadza get their land.\""}
{"prompt": "(CNN) -- Fifteen years ago, a bomb ripped through a federal building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, in the worst homegrown terrorist attack on U.S. soil. The April 19, 1995, attack killed 168 people, shattering the notion that America was largely immune to domestic terrorism. On Monday, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano traveled to to Oklahoma City to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the bombing. She joined survivors, local officials and others at a memorial ceremony, standing in silence for 168 seconds representing the number of dead. In a poignant moment, the names of each of the victims were later read aloud by relatives and colleagues, with speakers referring to their mothers, grandparents and others who died in the bombing. Napolitano told the gathering it was impossible to promise an end to terrorist attacks on American soil. \"Adversaries continue to look for ways to exploit our openness and to take innocent lives,\" she said, promising that her agency would continue to work \"day and night\" to prevent another attack. \"We can resolve even a successful attack will not defeat our way of life,\" Napolitano said, referring to how Oklahoma City responded to the 1995 bombing with community commitment that has become known as the Oklahoma standard. \"We can resolve that the Oklahoma standard becomes the national standard.\" Fifteen years later, the bombing's impact still reverberates with those who lived through it. Daniel Gordon, 37, who was about seven miles from the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building at the time of the blast, remembers feeling the force of the explosion as he backed out of a parking spot at a grocery store. \"It felt like I'd hit a car,\" he said of the concussion from the blast. \"I looked and saw a ton of smoke pouring from downtown.\" As the day went on, he saw the damage to the building and bodies being pulled from it. \"It was absolutely horrifying,\" said Gordon, a fourth-generation jeweler whose family's presence in Oklahoma predates statehood. \"It was horror in real life.\" An Army veteran, Timothy McVeigh, was eventually convicted on federal murder charges in connection with the bombing and executed in 2001. McVeigh said he set off the bomb in front of the Murrah building at 9:01 a.m., in part, to seek revenge against the U.S. government for its raid on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, on April 19, 1993. Of the people killed in the attack, 19 were children who were at a day care center in the facility. Miraculously, six children survived and are now teenagers and young adults. P.J. Allen, now 16, was 18 months old when the bomb brought the building down on top of him, forcing him to inhale hot air and smoke. \"His lungs were severely damaged,\" said Deloris Watson, Allen's grandmother. \"It was touch-and-go for P.J. for a long time.\" Now in high school, Allen works with a tutor every week and hopes to study mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He also loves sports, but his damaged lungs keep him from taking part competitively. \"My asthma stops me from running all the time,\" said Allen, who speaks with a hint of a rasp in his voice between quick pauses to catch his breath. \"Sometimes, coaches wouldn't want to play me because I might get hurt.\" Despite the hardships and years of surgeries, including numerous tracheotomies, Allen said he hardly ever asks, \"Why me?\" \"Because to me this is normal,\" Allen said. \"As far as I remember, this has been what my life has been like.\" Brother and sister Brandon and Rebecca Denny were hurt in the attack, although it was the older brother who received the more permanent injuries. While then-2-year-old Rebecca Denny required 240 stitches to patch her up, her brother -- then 3 -- suffered severe brain injuries, leaving the right side of his body weak. \"First of all, they said he might not live, and second of all, if he does live, he will never walk or talk again,\" said mother Claudia Denny. But Brandon Denny proved doctors wrong. He not only survived, but he is now a junior in high school with his sister. \"When you go through something like this, it just doesn't go away, like the next day or the next year. It affects you for your whole life,\" said Rebecca Gordon, who still wonders why she was lucky enough to survive. \"I wonder,\" she said, \"but I don't know, I guess I have something important to do.\" That sense of destiny is shared by another childhood survivor: Chris Nguyen, now a sophomore at the University of Oklahoma in nearby Norman. \"I've been given like a gift, you might say, and if I don't make something of my life to succeed and make a difference of some kind, then I would have wasted my life,\" he said. \"I think about the other parents -- all the other day care children and families -- who've lost someone ... but I feel guilty almost that Brandon, Rebecca, P.J. and I, we get to live our lives ... and the other people, they don't get that opportunity,\" he said. If anything good came out of the bombing, Gordon said, it was that the people of Oklahoma City forged a common bond. \"It was horrible, but so much good came out of it,\" he said. \"This whole city pulled it together. It was phenomenal.\" CNN's Don Lemon contributed to this report."}

First lady Michelle Obama dazzled in a Jason Wu original gown. The one-of-a-kind silk chiffon confection was embellished with organza rosettes, Swarovski crystal rhinestones and silver embroidery. The first lady accessorized with diamond chandelier earrings, a white gold and diamond ring and a stack of diamond bangles by jeweler Loree Rodkin. The president summed up his wife's look best before their first dance -- to Beyoncé's rendition of \"At Last\" -- when he said, \"First of all, how good-looking is my wife?\" Michelle Obama has worn Wu once before, during an interview with Barbara Walters. Wu, one of America's leading young designers, debuted his first collection in February 2006 and has since earned accolades such as Fashion Group International's Rising Star Award.  Watch InStyle.com's Joe Berean discuss the gown » . Obama was likely introduced to the designer in one of her favorite Chicago, Illinois, boutiques, Ikram. The new first lady has made a conscious effort to support young, diverse talent in the fashion community. In choosing Wu, who is originally from Taiwan, Obama continues a tradition of wearing American designers who hail from other countries. They include Cuban-American designers Isabel Toledo, who designed her yellow lace inauguration ensemble; Narciso Rodriguez, designer of the red and black dress she wore on election night; and designer Thakoon Panichgul, originally from Thailand, who designed the floral dress she wore the evening her husband accepted the Democratic nomination for president. Michelle Obama's style statement is one meant to inspire ethnic and class diversity in the world of fashion. Aside from being a socially conscious purveyor of style, Obama also sends a clear message of hope and promise by choosing colorful, reasonably priced pieces.  Watch the Obamas enjoy the night » . She prefers bright, cheerful shades such as yellow, electric blue, red and purple, and has been seen on multiple occasions in head-to-toe looks from moderately priced American retailer J.Crew. In fact, daughters Malia and Sasha braved Tuesday's chilly weather in coats from the brand's children's collection. Michelle Obama was first seen in J.Crew during a visit to the \"Tonight Show\" with Jay Leno on October 27. \"This is a J.Crew ensemble,\" she told the host. \"We ladies, we know J.Crew.\" The first lady also said she had a penchant for Internet shopping, saying, \"When you don't have time, you gotta click!\" Obama wore J.Crew again at the Kids' Inaugural Concert on Monday. She gave the colorful ensemble a luxe spin with dangling green sapphire earrings from Loree Rodkin and a Deco-inspired belt buckle. InStyle magazine Fashion Director Hal Rubenstein appreciates Obama's straightforward approach to fashion. \"People tend to think classic looks are synonymous with boring, but they're not,\" he explains. \"Michelle Obama has a specific style that works for her. She has a lady-like approach to style that is elegant and inspiring. \"What we'll see as a result is this idea of looking put-together and sophisticated, as opposed to being daring or flamboyant. It's all about looking polished, like you know what you're doing.\" Get a FREE TRIAL issue of InStyle - CLICK HERE! Copyright © 2009 Time Inc. All rights reserved."}
{"prompt": "(CNN) -- A New Jersey waitress who served in the Marine Corps for over two years told CNN Friday she is now getting tips from all over the world after she says a family refused to tip her because she is gay. \"I'm sorry but I cannot tip because I do not agree with what your lifestyle and how you live your life,\" a family member wrote on the receipt for $93.55 at Gallop Asian Bistro in Bridgewater, New Jersey. \"I was offended. I was mad at first, and then I was more so hurt,\" 22-year-old Dayna Morales told CNN. Morales, who did a tour with the Marine Corps between 2009 and 2011, said she has been \"out open and proud for years,\" but \"never discussed with them (the family) anything; it was their pure assumption.\" \"It's disrespectful and it's hurtful,\" she said. \"I feel bad for their children because that's how they are going to be raised.\" She says the trouble began when she approached the table of four -- a man, wife and two girls -- at around 7 p.m. Wednesday. Morales said that when she introduced herself as Dayna and told them she was going to be their server, the older woman \"looked at me and said, 'I thought you were going to say your name is Dan.'\" Morales was so upset about the incident, she vented on Facebook, and the group \"Have a Gay Day\" posted her story on their Facebook page. The response was overwhelming. \"People have sent me tips from all over the world just to show support. I have had people from Germany to South Africa, Australia to the UK, San Diego, everywhere.\" Morales says that between the people who have called in to the restaurant to give credit card numbers, those who have mailed tips, or donated to a special PayPal account the restaurant set up, she estimates that she has received more than $2,000 so far. She plans to donate the funds to the Wounded Warrior Project, and the restaurant plans to match the donations and give it to a local LGBT organization. \"It wasn't for the money. I never planned on this. I just wanted to vent,\" she said. \"The purpose was to inform people it wasn't OK.\" Morales, noting that gay marriage recently became legal in New Jersey, added, \"It's 2013. This shouldn't be going on.\" The general manager of the restaurant, Byron Lapola, did not release the family's names, adding that \"we fully respect our guests' privacy.\" Lapola posted support for Morales on the restaurant's Facebook page: . \"Dayna is one of our absolute best servers working here at Gallop. We as a team were deeply hurt by the events that transpired. I myself as the General Manager took it personal as my team treats each other like a family. I made sure that Dayna was compensated for the tip, as for emotionally I wish there was much more I could do. One thing I can say is that people of that woman's kind business is not welcome here at Gallop, and I can assure you that if they decide to dine here again that they will be turned away.\" Man's act of kindness a reminder that 'there is good in the world,' waitress says ."}

A six-year-old girl who almost drowned alongside her brother and father is doing well in hospital as doctors say she is 'out of immediate danger'. Florence Mynott suffered a heart attack when the boat she was in went over a 10ft weir along with her father, Julian, brothers Freddie, three and Archie, seven. Mr Mynott, an antiques dealer, was taking a 'little pleasure trip' on the river Avon near his home when tragedy struck, killing him and Freddie. His last moments were spent desperately trying to save the children when they were swept over the weir during  an afternoon paddle in their new rowing boat. Tributes: 'The best father you could have': Julian Mynott with his daughter Florence who is believed to be 'out of immediate danger' Tragic: Julian Mynott and his son Freddie who were drowned after their boat capsized at a weir in the river Avon in Barford, Warwickshire . Tragic: Freddie Mynott (right) died with his father when their boat went over a weir near their £660,000 home - his brother Archie and sister Florence survived . Florence and Archie were rescued from the fast-flowing water by a heroic villager soon after the boat capsized on Saturday afternoon. Mr Mynott, who specialised in high-end antiques and home furnishings, was seen attempting to swim towards his children near the upturned glass-fibre vessel but the current, increased by the recent heavy rain, was too strong. Yesterday his father, Roger, 69, spoke of the son he described as a ‘safety freak’ who lived for his children. From Pattaya, Thailand, where he runs . his own antiques and interior design business, Mr Mynott senior said his . son and wife Emma, 41, had spent a ‘fortune’ renovating their new . £660,000 riverside home. The couple chose the house in Barford, Warwickshire, specifically because of its waterside location in a quiet village. After . buying the property in January last year, they lived in a cottage in . the grounds until renovation work on the building was completed around . February this year. Search: Rescue teams look for the missing father and son on Saturday . Tragic scene: The 4ft-high weir on the River Avon where the family's rowing boat capsized . Support: Residents left floral tributes and cards to pay respect on the River Avon earlier today . Thoughts: Cards pay respect to Freddie and Julian Mynott from friends and residents who knew them . So delighted was Mr Mynott with the completed project he told his father he was ‘never going to move from the house’. Mr Mynott senior added: ‘He was so pleased with the house but now he will never get the chance to enjoy it. ‘I was due to come over to see it next week but now I will have mixed emotions. It’s a place where Julian spent so much time, love and money to make perfect, but he never got the chance to enjoy it.’ The tragic father, whose family pictures . were supplied to the Mail with the blessing of a close relative, bought . the boat as a treat for his children days before Saturday’s tragedy.

No sign: The Mynott's had only recently moved into their home in the affluent area of Barford, Warwickshire . Mr Mynott senior, who is flying home . to England today, said his son ‘must not have known about the danger’ posed by the 4ft weir yards from the end of his garden. ‘I spoke to him on Saturday afternoon . and he told me he was going out on the boat with his kids. He was so . happy and so excited that he was taking his kids boating – it was his . dream to go boating on the river. ‘I’m still struggling to come to terms . with it. He was the best father you could have – he just idolised his . children. He never let those children more than five yards from his . sight.’ Mr Mynott senior used to run an . antiques business in Warwick.

No go area: A road leading to a bridge remained closed after the father and son's bodies were pulled out of the river late last night . Back on the river: Despite the tragedy people still took to the river in Warwick today near to where the accident happened . Just moments . before the  incident, the quartet were seen wearing lifejackets and . paddling upstream – away from their home and the ‘fierce’  weir beyond. It is thought they were swept away as Mr Mynott tried to steer the boat back to the riverbank at the foot of their garden. Tributes: A couple pay their respects after laying flowers at the scene of the weir deaths . His father added: ‘It was a little pleasure trip, a few laps down the river and back and it all resulted in a terrible accident. ‘Julian was over-protective of his kids and for something like this to happen must have been agonising for him. ‘He spent whatever life he had left in himself trying to rescue those children.’ Mr Mynott senior described his son as a ‘one-off’ and a ‘wonderful husband and family man’.

{"prompt": "By . John Hall . Internet service providers will be able to offer websites preferential treatment in exchange for money if new plans to restructure the rules governing net neutrality are enforced, it has been claimed. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission is set to propose new rules that would allow companies to pay a premium for faster internet services to make them more attractive to consumers. The move would be seen as controversial as net neutrality rules are considered vital for users to freely select the websites they want to visit without companies steering them towards those which have paid extra money for business, political or other reasons. Premium: One potential issue could occur if bandwidth-heavy websites such as Netflix and Skype (pictured) are forced to pay extra to guarantee a smoother delivery - the cost of which could be transferred to consumers . The FCC's plans would grant internet service providers the power to decide which websites will be able to run at full efficiency and, perhaps more importantly, which will be restricted, according to the Wall Street Journal, which claims to have seen an early draft of the new regulations. One concern is that this power could easily be abused, with certain websites being given the fastest services while their competitors face limits and restrictions, making them less attractive to consumers. This theoretical abuse of power could, of course, be used for political as well as economic reasons. Another potential issue could occur if bandwidth-heavy websites such as Netflix and Skype are forced to pay extra to guarantee a smoother delivery - the cost of which could be transferred to consumers. The FCC's chairman Tom Wheeler is scheduled to present proposals for a change to net neutrality rules to members of the commission later today. The new rules are meant to replace the FCC's open internet order from 2010, which was struck down by a federal appeals court in January. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit affirmed that the FCC had the authority to create open-access rules but said it failed to establish that its 2010 regulations didn't overreach. Better service: The U.S. Federal Communications Commission is set to propose new rules that would allow companies to pay a premium for faster internet services to make them more attractive to consumers . While the older rules technically allowed for paid priority treatment, it was discouraged. The new rules are expected to spell out standards that such deals would have to meet to be considered 'commercially reasonable' and will be designed to survive a court challenge in the future. Under the proposed rules, if such a deal for priority access were challenged, the commission would look at its impact on competition, on consumers, on free speech and civic engagement, and whether a broadband provider was acting in good faith. The commission will also ask for comment on how to make such dealings more transparent, but didn't have a recommendation on the matter. The proposed changes would also restore a previous rule that prohibits internet service providers blocking access to websites, which could help start ups foster the growth of the internet economy. Part of changes would require the FCC to establish a minimum standard of service - soemthing it says it will ask the public to help with. Although the FCC says it is not currently seeking to treat internet providers as 'common carriers' such as telephone companies - which would subject companies like Comcast and Verizon to even stricter rules - it is keeping the option on the table. The draft rules kick off a policymaking process that involves commissioner votes and a public comment period before a final vote sometime this summer."}

A nationally syndicated columnist, Martin has said he will vote for Barack Obama in November. He is the author of \"Listening to the Spirit Within: 50 Perspectives on Faith\" and \"Speak, Brother! A Black Man's View of America.\" Visit his Web site for more information. Roland S. Martin says Lifeway Christian Stores should be given hell for its actions against GospelToday. (CNN) -- In the 19 years that Teresa Hairston has published her magazine, GospelToday, she has never faced a major situation with Christian bookstores across the country that carry the publication. She's tackled any number of issues over the years,and has featured a number of celebrities and ministers, ranging from Yolanda Adams to Bishop T.D. Jakes to Kirk Franklin. But when the Atlanta, Georgia, entrepreneur decided to feature five female pastors on her cover this month, she says, Lifeway Christian Stores treated her like she had converted her Christian publication to something akin to the tastes of porn purveyor Larry Flynt. Apparently, the owner of Lifeway, the Southern Baptist Convention, wasn't too happy with Hairston telling the story of female pastors, because the women go against their 2000 decree that only men can serve in the role of reverend or pastor. According to Hairston, the Christian company didn't even give her the courtesy of a heads-up. \"We got an anonymous tip,\" she told me Tuesday on The Tom Joyner Morning Show, and after checking it out, she discovered that the magazine had been removed from the shelves in all of Lifeway's 100-plus stores nationwide and had been placed behind the counter. \"They have never called me,\" Hairston said. \"Never sent an e-mail. Nothing. I had to go see my distributor to verify what they had done.\" The actions of Lifeway didn't stun me. I had seen this movie before. A few years ago, my wife was a longtime Lifeway teacher. She had taught at the company's teaching centers for years, but then one day, she was notified that she would have to take down her Web site and comply with their rules against female pastors or be dropped as a teacher. Her crime? Calling herself the Rev. Jacquie Hood Martin. It wasn't that she did so for the heck of it. She graduated from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary; was the first female staff pastor at Houston's Brookhollow Baptist Church/the Church Without Walls, a Southern Baptist Convention church; and has been leading folks to the Lord all over the country for 20 years. She was angered by Lifeway's decision but made it clear that she didn't serve the bookstore or even the Southern Baptist Convention. She made a commitment to serving Jesus Christ and was not about to back away from her call to ministry because a male-dominated organization decided that its interpretation of the Bible calls for a woman not to be in the pulpit. So she cut them off and kept on calling herself the Rev. Jacquie Hood Martin. Religious folks will quickly say that Scripture is clear that women can't be pastors and lead men, yet Hairston says that when she featured Pastor Paula White on her cover two years ago, Lifeway didn't take any action against the magazine. Anyone who has served in a church or been a member of any faith knows that there are those who have strict interpretations of their faith's writings, while others have a different interpretation. I've heard Brookhollow's pastor, the Rev. Dr. Ralph Douglas West Sr., preach several sermons stating that what Paul wrote in 2 Timothy with regards to only men preaching was specific to that church and not a blanket ban. Second, there were instances where Paul wrote that his views were his own and not mandates from God. That is a doctrinal fight that any of us can have any time (and I love it how these same Bible thumpers ignore the biblical story of Deborah, who was a judge in the Old Testament -- and was over men). But what is a greater issue is that Lifeway clearly has no respect for freedom of the press. Here is arguably the top Christian bookstore in the country making a decision based on their teachings and applying it to a magazine. A spokesman for Lifeway Resources, which runs the stores, was quoted in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution last week as saying of female pastors, \"It is contrary to what we believe.\" So does Lifeway and, by extension, the Southern Baptist Convention, fight vigorously for freedom of religion, but it doesn't give a hoot about the other freedoms guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution? I now wonder whether Lifeway makes it its business to cull through any number of magazines and search for stories that go against its doctrine and pull them from the shelves. This is the kind of nonsense that drives more people away from religion. I suppose it's fitting that this story would come out the same time as Bill Maher releases his religious documentary, \"Religulous,\" which skewers all the major religions for their dogma. I'm sure he feasted on positions of the Southern Baptist Convention. The conduct of Lifeway and the Southern Baptist Convention is shameful, and they owe Hairston an apology for their actions. Yet she's taken it in stride, saying that instead of giving the company hell, she'll \"give them heaven.\" I say, give them a lot of hell for this, because they deserve it for actions. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer."}
{"prompt": "By . Richard Spillett . and Andrew Levy . An unemployed couple who live off benefits with their 13 children have had hundreds of fish killed in their garden pond in a suspected grudge attack. Tim Fisk, 44, and Mandy Ball, 41, first attracted attention last year when their council house was combined with the one next door to create a seven-bedroom home. Last month they appeared in a television documentary where Mr Fisk threatened to have another child just to spite critics who accused them of sponging off the state. They have since complained of being subjected to verbal abuse and death threats because of their taxpayer-funded lifestyle. Scroll down for video . Tim Fisk says the fish pond at his family's six-bedroom council house has been poisoned in a hate campaign after his local authority were forced to knock two homes together to accommodate his brood . And it has now emerged that someone managed to break into their back garden in Ipswich, and poured a toxic chemical into their ornamental fish pond – killing 300 koi carp. The attack happened during the night of July 1, just eight days after the family appeared on Channel 5 programme Benefits Britain: Life on the Dole. Mr Fisk said: ‘The children went to play around the back garden and they saw all the fish were dead. Someone had chucked a load of bleach in my pond. ‘I just started crying because I love my fish. It’s disgusting to take it out on the poor fish. I’m upset about it and the children are as well.’ Mr Fisk has claimed that the fish were paid for when he worked as a security guard – and said he refused to be intimidated, adding: ‘I’m going to stand my ground. I have got a few more children – so what?’ But a neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: ‘It’s wrong for anyone to kill innocent fish but you have to wonder how someone on benefits can afford to keep 300 koi carp.’ Angry locals launched a petition to stop Mr Fisk and his family receiving the massive taxpayer-funded home . The father . of 13 insists that he is still unable to work as he has to care for his . 15-year-old son Daniel, who is blind in one eye and has learning . difficulties, and his partner Miss Ball, who suffers from depression. The . couple currently receive £53,000 in child tax credits, disability . living allowance, carer’s allowance, housing benefit and council tax . benefit every year. They . live with Sadie, 16, Daniel, Lauren, 13, Callum, 11, Kyle, ten, Elektra . Mae, five, Serenity, four, Jayden, three, Starlight, two,  14-month-old . Neatheus and Satin-Tia, seven months. Their . oldest daughters Charlie, 20, and Ashley, 18, have now moved out. During . the documentary, Mr Fisk said he was not going to be ‘dictated to and . told how many kids you can have'. The family, some of whom are pictured on holiday in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, say they've been abused after appearing in Channel 5 show 'Benefits Britain: Life on the Dole' He added: ‘Do you know what? I . think I’ll have another one.’ He also complained that the council had . not moved them to alternative accommodation while the £36,000 worth of . building work was being carried out. But dozens of locals have . petitioned Ipswich council to complain about the house, which also has . two bathrooms, a games room and a wet room. Police have been informed . that the fish were worth £1,000 and said they were treating the matter . as criminal damage. A Suffolk Police spokesman said: ‘It is believed . that a chemical substance was put in the pond water. As a result, 300 . koi carp died.’ He added: ‘There were bubbles on top of the water, . indicating that a chemical had been added. We are investigating and . appealing for any witnesses.’ According to members of the British Koi Keepers Society, koi carp can be bought for as little as £10 each in bulk, but for rarer varieties, owners can pay up to £20,000. An avid koi keeper in Malaysia recently paid around £180,000 for one fish, thought to be a record. To build and fit a fibreglass pond with heaters and filters can require as much as £15,000 and the extra cost of water and electricity to keep the pond heated and clean can put around £800 to £1,000 on top of owners' bills. Unheated pools cost less to maintain, but can still see water bills rise by about £400 a year due to the cost of changing 10 per cent of the water once a fortnight, as is recommended. The fish also need to be fed, with 15 koi eating their way through around £100 of pellets a year. The water should also be treated with medication, which costs around £50 to £100 a year."}

He is accused of molesting a teenager while filming a celebrity It’s a Knockout-type show in Cambridge during the 1970s – but claims he first visited the university city just four years ago. However, jurors at Southwark Crown Court were yesterday shown footage of Harris taking part in a show called Star Games filmed in Cambridge in 1978. Scroll down for video . After Rolf Harris previously denied having been to Cambridge earlier than four years ago, Southwark Crown Court was today shown a video of him appearing in a TV game show filmed in the city in the 1970s . Prosecutor . Sasha Wass QC told him the fresh evidence backed up the account of his . alleged victim, who said she was at the location when Harris groped her . bottom. But the veteran TV star replied: ‘I had no idea I was in Cambridge, and I don’t think the other performers or stars did either. ‘I was in Cambridge but I didn’t know I was in Cambridge.’ During . the opening credits of the Star Games final, a voiceover said the show . was coming from ‘Cambridge, a tranquil seat of learning.’ Harris . was announced by host Michael Aspel as captain of one of the celebrity . teams, which also included actors Colin Baker, Rula Lenska, Julian . Holloway and Robin Asquith. The Australian could be seen ‘jumping up and down like a kangaroo and mucking about amusingly’, Miss Wass said. She told Harris: ‘Michael Aspel seemed to know where he was because he introduced it as being on Jesus Green, Cambridge.’ Harris said: ‘That was the first time I had heard the word Cambridge. I had no idea. I don’t think any of us knew.’ He . told Miss Wass she ‘didn’t understand the showbiz scene’, saying he was . often driven from place to place without knowing the location. The . alleged victim had suggested the event had taken place in the centre of . Cambridge in about 1975 when she would have been 14. Footage shown in court today showed Rolf Harris taking part in the celebrity game show Star Games on ITV in 1978. The footage was released to the media today by the prosecution to show that his claim that he first visited Cambridge four years was a lie . Harris said in evidence he had not known where the show was filmed but was accused by barrister Sasha Wass of 'telling a deliberate lie' After the jury were shown a video of him in a game show in Cambridge in 1978, Harris claimed he had not realised the event had been held in the city . She told the court last month that she had been  working part-time to earn pocket money and was clearing up . when she saw  Harris entertaining crowds while pretending to be a dog. 'It was quite a funny scene to behold.' The woman, who is now 52, told the jury of six men and six women that Harris put his arm around her, and moved his hand up and down her back, before squeezing her bottom. With her voice wavering, she said: 'I can't remember the exact words but he made some motion to me 'come up', and I can see it in my mind's eye as clear as if it was happening now. He came up and put his arm around my left shoulder. 'It was quite a firm hold. I just stood there. I couldn't believe what was going on, this famous person putting his arm around me. 'To start it was a very nervous but a good feeling, however his hand then moved and his hand went up and down my back and his hand went over my bottom and it was very firm.' The woman said: 'I was too young to really understand the term but it was basically like groping. It was very firm and he squeezed it a few times. 'I was just completely frozen. I knew it was wrong. I couldn't move.' She said she was 'extremely embarrassed' and moved away as soon as Harris let go of her. The woman said she contacted the police after the revelations about Jimmy Savile in October 2012 and when it was publicly revealed that Harris had been arrested, because she wanted to back up any other alleged victims. Miss . Wass told Harris, who denies the assault: ‘The footage shows you . monkeying around pretending to be an animal – all of which fits the . description [the alleged victim] said she saw prior to being assaulted . by you. ‘You . have said categorically in this case that all the people who say they . had been sexually assaulted by you have lied. I’m going to suggest it is . you who is lying and that video demonstrates it. 'There . is no way you could have forgotten that event and you deliberately . tried to mislead the jury when you told them you had not visited . Cambridge until four years ago. That was a deliberate lie. ‘The film footage ... demonstrated it’s not the victims who have lied, it’s you who lied.’"}

A grandfather has told how he went to Specsavers to have his sight tested and was diagnosed with such high blood pressure he could have died. Derek Day, 72, from Solihull in the West Midlands, was rushed to Birmingham City Hospital after eye expert Raj Sandhu spotted warning signs during a routine appointment. Doctors were amazed when later tests gave a systolic blood pressure reading of 254 – people should aim for a blood pressure of below 120/80. Derek Day, 72, went to Specsavers to have his sight tested and was diagnosed with such high blood pressure he could have died . Systolic blood pressure is the maximum pressure the blood reaches as it is pushed around the body when the heart beats. A measurement of more than 140 represents high blood pressure. The result was so high that staff at the Birmingham Midland Eye Centre, based at the hospital, thought their machine was faulty, only for a second reading to return identical statistics. Mr Day said: ‘At first they thought the machine had broken, so they tried again. ‘When they got the same reading, they told me I should have been dead. ‘My pressure was that high they were surprised I was still standing. It was such a shock - I'd never had any health problems before. Mr Day was seen by Raj Sandhu (left) who was concerned by his recurring headaches and referred him to Birmingham City Hospital for tests . ‘I have no doubt that Raj saved my life.’ Mr Day was put on tablets to help lower his blood pressure and has been fine ever since. His problems started in October when he started to suffer from recurring headaches and thought his glasses needed to be changed. He saw Mr Sandhu at Specsavers' Yardley branch, in Birmingham. The optician explained: ‘Mr Day's pressure tests were normal and his prescription hadn't changed, but I wasn't happy with how he was. Doctors were amazed to find Mr Day had a systolic blood pressure reading of 254 - people should aim for a reading below 120. This is the pressure the blood is under when it is pumped away from the heart . ‘His body language was wrong and the constant headaches were a concern. I also spotted two small splinter haemorrhages near his optic nerve at the back of his eye.’ Mr Sandhu called the eye centre and staff agreed to see Mr Day immediately. Mr Day said: ‘Without that visit and their prompt action I would have almost certainly suffered a stroke and could well have died. ‘It's hard to believe an eye examination can pick these things up. I'm now on tablets and I've been fine ever since. Mr Day was put on tablets to help lower his blood pressure and is now in much better health. Without treatment it is highly likely that he would have had a heart attack or a stroke . ‘I'm a really chilled out person and don't get stressed about anything, so hopefully that helped me.’ High blood pressure, or hypertension, is dangerous because it puts extra strain on the heart and blood vessels. This causes them to become weak and damaged. The higher your blood pressure, the greater your risk of health problems is. High blood pressure can cause heart attacks, heart failure, strokes, kidney disease and arterial disease.

{"prompt": "A petty crime sealed a final decision to retire to the Greek island of Crete -- but it could be legitimate government action to rescue Greece from economic melt-down that eventually forces Bob and Anna Scott back to the UK. Lured by the Mediterranean diet and climate, the couple moved to the village of Kokkino Horio in western Crete from Gloucester in 1997. The burglary at their UK home was enough to seek a permanent move to a country known for its friendly welcome. \"There was no crime here in those days... and it's still the case,\" said Bob who recounted the story of leaving a camera in a taverna and returning the next day to find it still hanging on the back of the chair where it was left. Initially they rented but seven years ago they bought a plot of land, built their own home, learned Greek and settled. The couple still love the people and the country they have adopted but Bob paints a picture of a nation in a mess -- one where strikes are commonplace, officialdom is mistrusted and illegal payments and tax evasion are part of everyday life. However, the medicine needed to fix it could force out those who have retired to a country which is imposing higher taxation to rid itself of a chronic debt problem. According to Eurostat, Greece owed more than 140% of its annual GDP in 2010, and the country is currently reliant on a huge bailout. The European Commission says Greece's projected debt for 2011 stands at nearly €353 billion ($487 billion). Bob and Anna say they are facing an extra property tax of €500 ($690) next year and for the moment they say they can manage, but accountants are already sending letters to their clients warning that there may be more taxes on the way. Another British couple, Roy and Kate Cooper, who have also settled in Crete, say future tax increases may hit some ex-pats quite hard, particularly those on pensions. \"Luckily we haven't got a swimming pool or big house or big car which are being targeted to raise extra cash,\" said Roy. As well as extra taxes, the Greek government is working hard to stamp out tax evasion and reform public pensions. According to the Greek finance ministry's figures, last year it seized 555 yachts and imposed fines of  €3.4 billion ($4.7 billion). But Bob Scott says he continues to see regular evasion, explaining that shops may charge €25 ($35) for a purchase but give a receipt for €15 ($21) or no receipt at all. And he says many workers will ask for a small cash bribe to carry out a favour. \"Graft is a way of life,\" said Bob. \"People are looking for it. We've got used to it but we don't pay backhanders to people if they ask.\" Despite the frustrations, the couple are sympathetic to the plight of the Greek people and understand their anger. \"The current situation is driving most people to distraction because they realize the things being imposed on them are punitive -- absolutely nothing is being done to promote growth,\" said Bob. \"They see people at the top getting away with what they perceive as blue murder. \"There are so many good things about this place. The people are very nice, friendly, helpful and generous when they know you. We really enjoy it here and we wouldn't want to go back to the UK unless we were forced to.\" However, the couple believe an increased tax burden on their UK pension, which is their only income, could make it a possibility. The prospects for Greece are not promising. It has teetered on the edge of defaulting on its debts and the population is resentful of the austerity measures introduced so far. There are frequent protests and a public sector strike last week brought the country to a standstill. And there are other problems. According to Bob, local hotels have pegged their room prices for three years, but he said taxi driver strikes leave tourists stranded at the airport, and extra taxes could further discourage visitors and drive away those who have already moved to Greece and spend their money there."}
{"prompt": "Celtic have opened talks with Scotland captain Scott Brown over an extended contract that could eventually see him take on a player/coach role at Parkhead. Brown’s existing deal expires at the end of the season, by which point he will be just a few weeks short of his 30th birthday. The club have an option to extend the contract by a year but discussions have commenced with a view to securing a longer stay for the midfielder, who is set to skipper Scotland in the crucial Euro 2016 qualifier against the Republic of Ireland at Celtic Park on Friday night. Brown joined Celtic from Hibernian in 2007 for £4.4 million in what stands as a record transfer between Scottish clubs. He has been a mainstay for club and country ever since and his absence from Celtic’s early-season fixtures was seen within the club as a huge factor in the club’s failure to qualify for the Champions League. Scott Brown (left), pictured in action against FC Astra, is in talks over a new contract with Celtic . Brown is working towards his B license and could become a player-coach as part of his new deal . Brown has made no secret of his wish to end his playing days in Glasgow and last summer he enlisted with the SFA’s coaching course at Largs in an attempt to secure his B license.

{"prompt": "(CNN) -- A suspected leader of Mexico's Gulf Cartel has been arrested near the U.S. border, a Mexican official said Sunday. Mario Armando Ramirez Trevino was captured Saturday in Reynosa, near Texas, said Eduardo Sanchez, the Mexican government's security spokesman. Ramirez, also known as X-20, was found with three guns, nine cell phones, and thousands of dollars and pesos in cash, the spokesman said. According to the U.S. State Department, Ramirez is a ranking member of the Gulf Cartel. It had offered a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to his arrest and conviction. The Gulf Cartel is one of Mexico's major drug-trafficking organizations. It's not as powerful as it once was. Last week, authorities said they captured two dozen suspected members of the cartel -- including two top lieutenants. In September, they arrested Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sanchez, the then-reputed boss of the powerful Gulf Cartel. Ramirez' arrest is the second capture of a major cartel leader in just a few weeks. Authorities nabbed Zetas leader Miguel Angel Trevino Morales, one of Mexico's most wanted drug lords, last month. His arrest was the most significant blow to drug trafficking in Mexico since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December. The Zetas started out as the enforcement arm of Mexico's Gulf Cartel, but later split off and formed their own drug-trafficking organization. CNN's Nick Parker, Catherine E. Shoichet and Ana Melgar contributed to this report."}
{"prompt": "By . Emily Kent Smith . A doctor who is accused of taking advantage of 'desperate' cancer patients will have to justify his actions before a 'fitness to practise' panel. Doctor Julian Kenyon is facing a fitness to practise hearing after allegedly misleading cancer patients on the effectiveness of a treatment . Dr Julian Kenyon claimed his Sono Photo Dynamic Therapy (SPDT), which uses sonar and light, could kill tumour cells in 80 per of late-stage cancer patients, a tribunal heard today. For the a 20-minute treatment session, Dr Kenyon charged a rate of £300. The unconventional method is generally a last resort when other treatments fail, a representative of the GMC told the tribunal today. Dr Kenyon also told a patient that the treatment was more effective than traditional chemotherapy, it is alleged. The complementary medicine practitioner offered the ‘novel approach’ to one patient during a 20 minute consultation, at the Dove Clinic’s Wimpole Street consulting rooms, in Marylebone, central London. He also told an undercover reporter from The Sunday Times that the rate of ‘complete responses’, or long-term survivors, following the treatment, was just under 10 per cent. The journalist posed as a cancer patient’s husband in December 2012. Dr Kenyon, who trained in general medicine, is facing a fitness to practise hearing in Manchester. The hearing began today and has been listed for 10 days. Dr Kenyon admits making the assertions, but denies any of his conduct was dishonest or misleading. The General Medical Council (GMC) alleges that Dr Kenyon overstated the effectiveness of the treatment - without enough evidence to support his claims. Ben Fitzgerald, for the GMC, said: ‘Dr Julian Kenyon faces an allegation that his fitness to practise is impaired by reason of his misconduct. ‘The misconduct in question concerns Dr Kenyon’s misleading statements made in late 2012 to two individuals, one a genuine patient with advanced cancer and the other an undercover reporter posing as the husband of a woman with advanced cancer, about the effectiveness of a private medical treatment he was offering to provide.’During treatment, a patient is given a ‘sensitiser’ then exposed to a light bed and a hand-held ultrasound device, the hearing was told. This is said to activate the sensitiser within the tumour site and kill cancer cells as well as provoking an immune response within the patient, the panel heard. SPDT is a development of a conventionally accepted treatment, Photodynamic Therapy (PDT), which uses light alone to activate the sensitiser for tumours lying on or close to the skin. SPDT is said to have the ability to penetrate deeper into the body than some treatments. Mr Fitzgerald said: ‘The GMC’s case is that SPDT is indeed a novel form of treatment and one in respect of which the evidence of effectiveness is, and was in 2012, extremely limited. ‘It is also the kind of unconventional private treatment that patients with advanced and serious forms of cancer may turn to, in a state of some desperation, after the failure of conventional forms of treatment to address their condition. ‘In this context it is essential that any doctor offering the treatment should provide accurate and non-misleading information about the evidence of its effectiveness. ‘The GMC alleges that Dr Kenyon’s statements about SPDT were misleading, because they had the effect of overstating the evidence of its effectiveness without drawing attention sufficiently to the limitations of the evidence.’ Mr Fitzgerald told the panel that while Dr Kenyon appears to be a genuine enthusiast of the new treatment which may prove to be effective, his knowledge of the evidence available at the time meant that the picture he painted of the service was not justified. ‘Accordingly, it is alleged that Dr Kenyon’s conduct was dishonest as well as simply misleading,’ he added. The Dove Clinic on Wimpole Street where Dr Kenyon is alleged to have 'misled' patients over the effectiveness of a novel cancer treatment . A man in the late stages of cancer, known only as Patient A, consulted Dr Kenyon in September 2013 after researching alternative therapies. The patient has since died from the illness, but was recommended SPDT by Dr Kenyon to treat the disease. The medic is alleged to have said ‘there is a strong possibility that we would be able to increase your median survival time’. Dr Kenyon did make it clear that it was not a cure, but an experimental treatment which needed further trials, but did say there was a ‘strong possibility’ of extending the patient’s life. ‘Patient A was a man with advanced cancer who was seeking assistance from alternative therapies in a desperate situation,’ Mr Fitzgerald said. ‘Dr Kenyon’s statement regarding his survival time, whether considered on its own or in the context of all the other communication with Patient A, was misleading.’Reporter Jonathan Ungoed-Thomas posed as the husband of a woman suffering from breast cancer during a meeting with Dr Kenyon in December 2012, during which he raised the subject of SPDT. Dr Kenyon explained the theory before telling him: ‘You don’t have to belong to a religion to believe in it. It’s not some wacky idea.’ He went on to say it was more effective than chemotherapy in similar cases claiming it resulted in ‘significant tumour cell death’ in 80 per cent of patients. He also suggested the rate of long-term survivors was just under 10 per cent. Dr Kenyon also repeated the key claims in later correspondence with Mr Ungoed-Thomas once he had revealed he was a journalist. Dr Kenyon maintains the treatment is effective and denies his actions were dishonest or misleading. In his witness statement he said: ‘I deny ever acting in a deliberately misleading or dishonest way towards anybody during the course of a consultation, whether a bona fide patient or otherwise’. Dr Kenyon runs The Dove Clinic, in Twyford, Hampshire and also has consulting rooms in Wimpole Street, central London. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article."}

The buyer recently approached auction house Bonham’s in London with the intention of selling the prints to the highest bidder. A representative for the auction house told The Guardian that they are expected to fetch roughly $65,000 and $95,000, respectively. During his month-long residency in New York City last October, Banksy vowed to produce one piece of street art each day. On the 13th day of his residency, the UK-based artist displayed dozens of original, signed canvases at a pop-up stall attended by an unknown man.

{"prompt": "Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- Britain says it will continue to press for an independent investigation into the case of three British citizens who say they were tortured before being sentenced Monday to four years in prison on drug charges in the United Arab Emirates. Grant Cameron, Karl Williams and Suneet Jeerh, all in their mid-20s, say they have been subjected to electrical shocks and other abuse. In a letter to London-based legal charity Reprieve, British Prime Minister David Cameron wrote that \"our concerns about the allegations of torture ... have been repeatedly raised with the Emirati authorities, including by the Foreign Secretary and (Foreign Office Minister) Alastair Burt.\" The prime minister added that \"the absence of an independent medical examination (of the men) remains a concern,\" and that Britain continues to press for evidence of a full, impartial and independent investigation. The manager of the Dubai police human rights department, Mohammad Al-Mur, said investigators looked into allegations that the men had confessed after being tortured and found no evidence to support the claims. Al-Mur told CNN Arabic that men's accusations \"were rejected after being investigated in accordance with international standards by Dubai police.\" The developments come a day ahead of UAE President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al Nahyan's scheduled state visit to Britain. Cameron, Williams and Jeerh were arrested in July and charged with consumption and possession of the synthetic cannabis product known as spice. Their conviction Monday on the consumption charges carries a minimum of four years of imprisonment. The supply charges against the men were dropped, said Kate Higham, a lawyer for Reprieve. Higham has been in touch with the defendants' attorneys, who have declined to speak with CNN. While pleased that the defendants did not get heavier sentences, \"we think they should not have been convicted at all,\" Higham said. \"We will continue to push for the men's release and return in light of the torture they have suffered. We hope the UAE president would take this opportunity to show that he shares the British public's concern about torture,\" Higham said. The men could have faced 15 years if convicted of possession with intent to distribute. In a text, Cameron's mother, Tracy Cameron, called the sentence \"great news.\" Rights group: Britons tortured after arrest on drug charges . Claims of abuse . The men say police beat them and subjected them to electric shocks after their July 10 arrest, according to Reprieve, which provides legal support to prisoners. The case began when Cameron and Williams were visiting Dubai on vacation. Jeerh had moved to Dubai from Britain about six weeks earlier in hopes of getting a job in media, Higham said. The Britons were driving a rented car, and when they reached Jeerh's apartment building, they were arrested. The three allege they were then taken to the desert and then to Williams' and Cameron's hotel, said Marc Calcutt, who had earlier represented them on behalf of Reprieve. \"I remember that the police put a towel on my face so I could not see. They kept telling me I was going to die,\" Williams said in a statement released by Reprieve. \"Then they took off the towel and I could see that there was a gun pointed at my head ... I started to believe that I was going to die in that room.\" At one point, police pulled his pants down and zapped his testicles with electric shocks, Williams alleged. Calcutt also said Williams' hand was kicked until it was broken and said he has X-rays to prove it. Tracy Cameron said her son told her that police used a Taser on him and put guns to their heads, but she said she hasn't been able to get all the details because he is never alone. The men were pressured to sign documents in Arabic, without translation, after multiple beatings, Reprieve said. A \"neutral party\" appointed to investigate if any torture had occurred found the claims untrue, a Dubai police statement released in February said. But Calcutt said he was skeptical. \"No one knows who that neutral party is. I have not seen a report. I would love to see any investigative report,\" Calcutt said.

In an all-too familiar scene, they flirt, pout and pose for the tourists, men seeking sex in exchange for cash and curious sightseers on the street outside. 'De Wallen' is the largest red-light district in the city and consists of a network of alleys containing hundreds of tiny one-room cabins rented by prostitutes to ply their trade.

Suddenly, one of the women begins to shake violently, causing those wandering by to stop and watch, unsure as to what is happening. One by one the women join in with her curious actions, before amazing the crowd by launching into a storming, intricately choreographed dance routine. The crowd is delighted, cheering their approval and applauding. Some even begin to dance along with them while on the floor above, two more dancers join in the show. Amazingly, the dance is in sync, even though the women are in separate cubicles . One man captures the show on his mobile phone .

{"prompt": "A third of Britons would refuse to let their elderly parents move in with them if they needed full-time care, a report revealed yesterday. But soaring numbers are choosing to take in a lodger – as long as they are willing to pay for it. According to the research, just 28 per cent of adults would be happy for ageing parents to come and live with them if they needed 24-hour support. Asked how they would feel if their parents went into a care home, responses included ‘sad, guilty, concerned or emotional’ But the overwhelming majority would not be so welcoming, with a third (32 per cent) saying they ‘would not let their parents move in’ and just over a third (36 per cent) admitting they ‘would have to seriously think about it’. However when asked how they would feel if their parents went into a care home, responses included ‘sad, guilty, concerned or emotional’. The report, by care home provider Care UK, touches on one of the biggest social problems facing Britain – the future of pensioners at a time when many are living longer than ever before. As long as old parents are healthy and do not want to move in with their offspring, then all is well . Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the number of centenarians in the UK has increased by more than 70 per cent over the past ten years, taking it to a record 13,350. Meanwhile, the number of home-owners renting out a room to a lodger has almost doubled over the past five years, according to a separate report from financial services firm LV. The report said around 715,000 home-owners currently have a lodger, compared to just 369,600 in 2009. In a sign of the financial pressure facing many Britons, the most common reason was ‘to help with the bills’, followed by boosting their savings and having more disposable income. However unlike lodgers – who pay on average £3,000 in rent a year – many people’s elderly parents are ill, in need of care and are short of cash to pay for it. Dr Ros Altmann, a leading old age expert, said she was ‘astonished’ that such a small proportion of children are prepared to have their elderly parents living with them. She said: ‘Family help should surely be give and take – not just one way. ‘Of course it is possible they feel their homes are not big enough to house their parents. There is so much loneliness among older people in this country and part of it seems to stem from more families living further apart. In other countries, there does seem to be a greater degree of concern for older family members.’ Around 2,000 people in the UK – whose parents are older than 60 – took part in the investigation about their willingness for their elderly relatives to live with them if they needed to. Of those who said they wouldn’t let their parents move in, half said it was because their home was too small. Four in ten said they ‘would not be able to cope’, while one in five said they lack the ‘necessary skills to look after their parents’. Common conditions among the elderly in need of care include dementia, Parkinson’s disease, arthritis, heart disease or a general lack of mobility. And the problem of care looks set to worsen over the coming decades. For example, the Alzheimer’s Society predicts the number of over-60s with Alzheimer’s and related conditions could more than double from 800,000 to two million by 2050, putting huge pressure on both the NHS and social services. Maizie Mears-Owen, from Care UK, said: ‘The thought of moving parents into a care home can come with great concern. ‘Often the decision is made at crisis point when parents need a level of care which families may not be able to provide.’"}
{"prompt": "(CNN) -- Professor Peter Furth has ridden his bicycle to work at Northeastern University each day for the past six years. The two-mile trip through the Boston suburb of Brookline, Massachusetts, is usually without incident. Furth's journey is worlds apart from his former Boston commute, which for 13 years was a battle with drivers who wanted him on the sidewalk. \"I've had motorists that drive a couple of inches from my elbow, trying to scare me,\" he said. Furth would catch up with drivers at stoplights and ask them whether they knew how close they'd come to hitting him. Invariably, they would say, \"Yes, move over.\" It's a cultural thing, he said. In the town of Cambridge, motorists see bicyclists all over the place and are considerate. In Brookline, only every now and then does someone honk or yell. In the southern part of Boston, it's not quite war, but the relationship isn't very friendly. Although the street signs say \"Share the road,\" there's still a long road to travel before that sign reflects the reality, bicyclists say. Motorists often see bands of bikes on the streets on the final Fridays of each month as cyclists across the nation gather for evening group rides called Critical Mass. The purpose, advocates say, is to make cars and trucks more aware of bicyclists. But to some drivers, Critical Mass participants are nothing more than spandex-wearing, stop-sign-running Lance Armstrong wannabes who slow traffic. 'They think they own the road' It's somewhat symbolic of the tension on the roads. \"The roads were made for cars,\" KTAR-FM radio guest host John Hook said in Phoenix, Arizona, last month. \"And bicyclists share the road, but sometimes they think they own the road.\" One caller to the program was a long-haul truck driver who accused many bicycle riders of failing to respect the law and not riding with the flow of traffic. A caller who identified himself as Jeff said he witnessed an incident in which a pack of bicyclists almost hit a car that had the right of way. Then the riders screamed at the motorist. \"I actually think the bikes are more disrespectful to the cars than the cars are to the bike,\" Jeff said. The number of cyclists is increasing. Although bike sales took a dip during the recession of 2009, more than 18 million were sold each year for the seven previous years, according to the National Sporting Goods Association. About 27 percent of adults in the United States bike at least once a summer, according a survey released in 2008 by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Most bicyclists ride for recreation or exercise, while a small percentage ride to work. In Portland, Oregon, which is ranked second on Bicycling magazine's list of Top 50 Bike Friendly Cities, more than 6 percent of residents commute by bike to work. That's up from 1 percent two decades ago. See a map of the top 10 bike-friendly cities . Things are looking up, at least in the eyes of cyclists. Many cities are putting in bike lanes and paths. Google adds bike routes to maps . More than $730 million in federal stimulus funds has been allocated for bike and pedestrian projects, according to AmericaBikes.org. Washington is getting into the act. U.S. Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood drew cheers from the cycling world in March when he blogged that the administration was \"integrating the needs of bicyclists in federally-funded road projects\" and advising state departments of transportation to treat biking and walking \"as equals with other transportation modes.\" That drew an outcry from industry, which saw the new policy as taking money away from large transportation construction needs. \"Treating bicycles and other non-motorized transportation as equal to motorized transportation would cause an economic catastrophe,\" Carter Wood, a senior adviser at the National Association of Manufacturers, told The New York Times. \"If put it into effect, the policy would more than undermine any effort the Obama administration has made toward jobs. You can't have jobs without the efficient movement of freight.\" Five blocks of controversy . Michael Ritchey is an avid biker and believes that bike lanes are good idea. He just thinks the project to add them to a five-block stretch of Hillsborough Street in Raleigh, North Carolina, is folly -- and dangerous. Hillsborough Street is one of the main arteries in Raleigh and borders the northern part of North Carolina State University and its 30,000 students. There are bars and shops and small restaurants. And lots of cars. The city, working with the state, has decided to redo the four-lane road, and when the project is done, there will be two lanes for cars, a center median and bike lanes on each side. Ritchey, who owns Global Village Organic Coffee and is a weekend cyclist, fears that bikers will get hurt. \"They are putting [the bike lanes] in the wrong place,\" he said. \"It's more of a symbolic gesture.\" And it doesn't help that the relationship between cars and bicyclists in the city is \"antagonistic at best,\" he said. Ritchey is worried that distracted college students won't be on the lookout for bikers and someone will get hurt when a car door opens at the wrong time or someone texting will have an accident (he's seen that twice with cars). He said one of his business neighbors opposes the projects because he fears that he will lose parking spaces in front of the bar. City councilwoman Nancy McFarlane points out that the bikers are already there on Hillsborough and other in-town streets, and the city of 348,000 is growing quickly. Many people are moving into the downtown area, and last year, the city revised its comprehensive plan. \"The old one was all about the car, and we want to become a multimodal city,\" she said. \"That includes bikes, buses and light rail.\" Steve Waters is one resident in favor of bike lanes. The freelance programmer works at home and uses his bike for short errands. He said that although some Hillsborough Street business owners might be concerned about losing money because of less car traffic, the opposite is likely to happen. \"It enhances the local economy,\" he said. \"It's all about creating options.\" Bicycling.com: The best road bikes of 2010 . Not every street should get a bike lane . Although opponents say the money is better spent on other road projects, cycling advocates say the lanes are needed to make the roads safer and less congested. Denver, Colorado, is ranked 12th on Bicycling magazine's list. The city has little room for new roads, municipal bike planner Emily Kreisa said. She said Denver is interested in using bicycles to eliminate congestion and to help the environment, but they don't just add a bike lane anywhere. Bicycling.com: Five cities to watch . \"We look at the traffic volume, the turning issues and how much room we have in the right of way,\" she said. \"In choosing any kind of [project], the first thing is what is the connection to the system, then what is the characteristic of the road and then how do we need to provide for the cyclist.\" Denver received $250,000 of stimulus money for cycling projects and is going to add 11 miles of bike lanes. The city is using its own funds to paint sharrows (painted bike symbols on the asphalt with arrows showing cyclists the way) to connect the roads of the network. Kreisa, who bikes 10 miles to work, says Denver is by far the easiest place she has commuted on two wheels. \"I've had one person honk at me and one person tell me to move over to the right,\" she said of her two years in the city. \"There are a lot of active people here who are also cyclists.\""}

This man, whose hands and face have been bandaged after the blast, was also wounded in the explosion . Vladimir Putin today vowed the total destruction of terrorists in a hard-hitting New Year message. 'I am certain that we will fiercely and consistently continue the fight against terrorists until their complete annihilation', he said in his annual televised address at midnight. The strongman rewrote his New Year address even as the start of 2014 rolled across Russia's nine time zones. 'We bow our heads before the victims of cruel terrorist acts,' he said in his revamped message which came on a day that funerals began for the bomb victims. His original address, heard by residents in the extreme east of Siberia, the first to see in the New Year, contained no reference to the bombings. Putin's new version was delivered from Khabarovsk - seven hours ahead of Moscow - in the Far East of Russia where he flew to celebrate the New Year with victims of summer flooding. 'In the current year, we have encountered problems and have been challenged by serious experiences, including ones like the inhuman acts of terror in Volgograd,' he said. His spokesman said he 'broke a longstanding tradition' in ripping up his original message to deliver his uncompromising warning to Islamic extremists who are blamed for the Volgograd carnage. The attacks posed a challenge to President Vladimir Putin, who oversaw a war that drove rebels from power in Chechnya over a decade ago but has been unable to quell the Islamist insurgency that erupted in its wake. Volgograd - formerly Stalingrad - is a city of about 1million and a transport hub for an area of southern Russia that includes Chechnya and the other mostly Muslim provinces of the North Caucasus, where the insurgency generates deadly violence almost every day. A car bomb killed a prosecutor's assistant in Dagestan, a hub of Islamist militancy in the Caucasus, on Tuesday, and two people were killed in a bomb blast there late on Monday, authorities said. Putin has staked his prestige on the Games in Sochi, which lies at the Western edge of the Caucasus Mountains and within the strip of land the insurgents want to carve out of Russia and turn into an Islamic State. He ordered increased security nationwide after the attacks, the deadliest outside the North Caucasus since a suicide bomber from a province next to Chechnya killed 37 people at a Moscow airport in January 2011. Volgograd was also the scene of an attack in October, when a woman from Dagestan killed seven people in a suicide bus blast. The violence raised fears of a concerted campaign before the Olympics, an important project for Putin, who secured Russia's first post-Soviet Games in 2007, during his initial 2000-2008 stint as president. Intended to showcase how Russia has changed since the collapse of Soviet communism in 1991, the Games have also been a focus for complaints in the West and among Russian liberals that Putin has stifled dissent and encouraged intolerance. This month, Putin freed jailed opponents . including oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky and the Pussy Riot punk band . in what critics said was an effort to disarm Western criticism and . improve his image. In an online video posted in July, the Chechen leader of insurgents who want to carve an Islamic state out of mainly Muslim provinces south of Volgograd, urged militants to use 'maximum force' to prevent the Games from going ahead. International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach condemned the 'despicable attack on innocent people' and said he had written to Putin to express condolences and confidence that Russia would deliver 'safe and secure games in Sochi'. The U.S. government is concerned Islamist militants may be preparing attacks aimed at disrupting the Olympics and has offered closer co-operation with Russia on security."}
{"prompt": "(CNN) -- It has been four years since Tiger Woods won a major title, but the former world No. 1 insists he still has time to beat the record held by his hero Jack Nicklaus. The \"Golden Bear\" won his last major at the age of 46, six years after his 17th triumph -- and Woods, stuck on 14 wins, says he plans to play for just as long. \"Absolutely. With the fitness routine and eating properly and staying in shape I could play for a very long time and I'm looking forward to that opportunity,\" the 36-year-old Woods told CNN's Living Golf in an exclusive joint interview with his heir apparent, Rory McIlroy. \"If you say hypothetically 10 years, that's 40 more major championships I get a chance to play in and compete in and try to win, and hopefully I can try to at least win five of those.\" Woods, McIlroy 'too tired' for $7M Chinese tournament . Woods ended a long wait for a title of any kind in March, won again in June, and overtook Nicklaus on the all-time PGA Tour list with his third victory of the season in July. It was his 74th overall, putting him behind only Sam Snead's 82. However, over the the last four years Woods' best finish in a major was 11th, and he has been plagued by constant questioning about his ability to follow up his last win at Torrey Pines -- which came at the cost of a serious knee injury that sidelined him for several months. \"Every press conference I go to I get hammered -- 'Oh you're never going to win again blah blah blah' -- and it was every tournament I went to,\" said Woods, who ended 2012 second on the PGA Tour money list behind McIlroy with more than $6 million in earnings. \"It was a lot there for about a year and a half where I had to answer that question every single round, pre-tournament, and to do that all a lot and then to pass Jack on the all-time win list this year and do it 10 years younger than him, I think that's a pretty neat accomplishment.\" McIlroy beats Woods in chaotic 'Duel of Jinsha Lake' This year McIlroy won his second major, the PGA Championship in August, at the tender age if 23 -- slightly younger than when Woods won his second at the same event in 1999. \"I'm halfway there to the career slam,\" McIlroy said. \"I've won two, and when I get my third I want to try and get my fourth. \"It's never been something that I've put a number on -- obviously I looked up to Tiger so much as a kid and obviously he's always had that goal of trying to surpass Jack's number and maybe one day I'll think about it a little more and try and put a number on it, but right now I'm at two and I want to get to three. \"I think the next big goal for me is if I could win the career gland slam, it would be a huge point. Not many players have done it in the past and it would be great to add my name to that list.\" Will McIlroy join Tiger at Nike in $20M a year deal? At the peak of his powers, Woods held all four major titles after 2001's Masters victory -- three of them coming in the previous season. It's the closest any golfer of the modern era has been to a calendar grand slam -- a feat only achieved by Bobby Jones in 1930 when two of the tournaments were amateur championships. \"It was just the best run of golf that was ever seen,\" McIlroy said of Woods' achievement -- known as the \"Tiger Slam.\" \"Holding all four major championships at the one time is incredible,\" added McIlroy. \"It is probably just a pity that it didn't all happen in the one year because I am not sure that would ever happen again.\" McIlroy and Woods were both criticized for missing the World Golf Championship event in China immediately after their \"Duel on Jinsha Lake\" exhibition last week, citing fatigue in a busy end to the season. But McIlroy insisted his biggest challenge is to avoid burnout. \"One of the biggest things for me is longevity. I have still got a lot of years ahead of me. I just don't want to be burnt out,\" he said. \"I don't want to get to the stage where I am 30 or 35 years old and I ... I don't want to say fed up with the game, but it is a long time to be playing the sport and I just want to pace myself. \"I think Tiger has done that so well for the last 15 years and that is something that I am going to try to do going forward.\" Scott: 'McIlroy can dominate like Tiger' Woods said he fully understands the pressures McIlroy is facing as one of golf's biggest drawcards, having blazed that trail himself for more than a decade. \"Everyone is going to be trying to bring you to their event, deter you away from time that is spent practicing,\" said the American. \"How did you get there? You didn't get there by sitting on your butt the entire time, you got there by working hard and doing all the things you need to do to prepare, and people are going to be trying to take you away from that. \"So trying to manage one's time -- for me that has been the biggest key. \"Some guys they just show up and they try to practice just for the week and build themselves into it. I would much rather practice at home, be ready. \"When I go to an event it is to win, period. I learned that at a very early age.\""}

{"prompt": "(CNN) -- British Prime Minister David Cameron will make the call at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland for international action to curb the activities of tax havens, which campaigners say cost governments trillions in lost revenues. Journalist Simon Hooper points out what he calls the hypocrisy of the UK's position, itself sitting at the center of the world's most powerful offshore empire. Walking up London's Strand in the direction of St. Paul's Cathedral does not feel like crossing one of the major financial fault lines in the global economy. Few tourists would perhaps even notice the stone dragon stranded between buses in the middle of the road that marks the boundary of the City of London, the British capital's financial district and one of global capitalism's most dynamic engines. Yet to step into the City is to enter what has been described by Nicholas Shaxson, author of \"Treasure Islands: Tax Havens and the Men Who Stole the World,\" as \"an offshore island inside Britain.\" Britain's role at the center of an empire of tax havens is under scrutiny this week, ironically, because British Prime Minister David Cameron has made tax evasion the central theme of this week's G8 meeting in Northern Ireland. \"Tax evasion and avoidance are issues whose time has come. After years of abuse people across the planet are rightly calling for action,\" says a British government briefing released ahead of the summit. Cameron's initiative has thrust the spotlight on the UK's overseas territories and crown dependencies, an odd collection of colonial offcuts including the Cayman Islands, the British Virgin Islands, Bermuda and Jersey. All are considered offshore hubs, and all benefit from close ties to the UK finance industry, pouring money into the City. On Saturday, Cameron announced that 10 territories and dependencies had agreed to sign up to an existing convention on corporate transparency promoted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), saying: \"It is important we are getting our house in order.\" But campaigners, such as the Tax Justice Network's John Christensen, remain skeptical whether Cameron can accomplish anything that will meaningfully challenge the power of the tax havens. He says measures such as greater transparency in company ownership, though welcome and necessary, do not go far enough in opening up other offshore structures, including trusts, to scrutiny. Britain is far from alone among G8 countries in the promotion and provision of offshore-style facilities. The U.S. provides parallel structures offering low taxes and corporate secrecy with the New York Times reporting last year on how legitimate businesses and criminal enterprises were flocking to Delaware \"in hopes of minimizing taxes, skirting regulations, plying friendly courts or, when needed, covering their tracks.\" Japan and several European Union countries also featured on the last Financial Secrecy Index, published in 2011 and topped by Switzerland. Of the UK though, the index said: \"If the entire British network of secrecy jurisdictions were considered, it would easily be ranked number one.\" Legal tax avoidance, which involves shifting profits to jurisdictions that do not levy corporate tax via offshore subsidiaries, and tax evasion, its criminal cousin, have long been among the perks of wealth. As Leona Helmsley, the New York hotelier and so-called \"Queen of Mean,\" is quoted as saying : \"We don't pay taxes. Only the little people pay taxes.\" Helmsley, who was convicted of tax evasion, denied having said this, but the words followed her for the rest of her life. Yet the consequences of this industry are borne by those who can least afford it. Aid charity ActionAid estimated last month that almost half of all investment into developing countries was funneled through tax havens; this means the profits from that investment remain offshore, depriving the world's poorest countries of much-needed revenues. It cited one transaction alone conducted through UK-linked havens that would have netted the Indian government $2.2 billion in tax; enough to provide a lunchtime meal to every Indian primary schoolchild for a year. A report last month by Kofi Annan's Africa Progress Panel highlighted mining deals in the DR Congo which had cost the country an estimated $1.36 billion in revenues, enough to double the country's health and education budgets. Yet attempting to estimate exactly how much money is concealed offshore is largely futile, with most experts willing to venture only that the figure runs into many trillions. An investigation last year conducted for the Tax Justice Network estimated that $21 to $32 trillion was hidden offshore by super-rich individuals alone. Campaigners such as TJN's John Christensen are skeptical whether the G8 can accomplish anything that will meaningfully challenge the power of the tax havens. He says proposed measures, though welcome and necessary such as greater transparency in company ownership, do not go far enough in opening up other offshore structures, including trusts, to scrutiny. History also suggests the City of London and its allies will defend their own interests. The City's origins are lost in the distant past, with the corporation's own website describing the area as \"a prime location for trade since before Roman times.\" Its tradition of self-governance predates the consolidation of the modern British state, and the City's powerbrokers have fiercely defended their ancient privileges ever since, using their role as lenders to crown and government as leverage. Should Queen Elizabeth II, the UK's head of state, feel the urge to cross the City's boundaries to visit the Starbucks on Fleet Street for a low-tax latte, ceremony dictates that she should still seek the permission of the City's Lord Mayor to do so. (Starbucks in December 2012 offered to pay additional taxes in the UK in response to public pressure there to collect more taxes from multinational companies.) And since 1571, an official known as the Remembrancer has maintained a seat in the House of Commons to protect and promote the City's interests in parliament, even as a turbo-charged 21st century financial infrastructure has been bolted onto this medieval statelet. But the use of the offshore sector has long been virtually endemic among a wealthy elite in the UK, even beyond the City's boundaries. British governments once attempted to curb the power and independence of the financial sector, hamstrung only by their borrowing dependency on the same source. Yet since the 1980s, the era of Margaret Thatcher's so-called \"Big Bang\" of markets deregulation, governments have enjoyed a cosier relationship with corporate finance, summed up by Peter Mandelson, a close ally of Tony Blair, who once said the once-socialist Labour Party was \"intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich.\" The rest of that quote -- \"... as long as they pay their taxes\" -- is less well remembered. In 2011, Cameron's coalition passed legislation exempting UK-based corporations from income tax on overseas earnings; a move described by commentator George Monbiot as a \"corporate coup d'etat.\" Research published by ActionAid showed that 98 out of 100 companies on the FTSE 100 index used offshore subsidiaries, with more registered in Jersey and the Cayman Islands than in India and China. And it has long been a rite of passage for newly-minted Britons, from Formula One drivers to musicians to self-made millionaires, to shift their riches to Switzerland, Monaco or Jersey with the public raising little more than an eyebrow in reproach. Research by the Guardian newspaper last year revealed how Cameron's own father had built a considerable family fortune by running a legal network of offshore investment funds. Cameron and other members of his family declined to comment on the report. Yet that situation may be changing, with campaign groups such as UK Uncut stirring up populist anger against corporate tax avoidance and politicians now scrambling to get on the bandwagon, while celebrity tax-dodging schemes have joined sex and drugs scandals as tabloid staples. Recent exposure of the legal tax avoidance strategies of Google and Amazon saw executives from both companies summoned for scrutiny by the UK's parliamentary public accounts committee where lawmaker Margaret Hodge told Google Vice President Matt Brittin: \"You are a company that says you do no evil. And I think that you do do evil.\" In the U.S., meanwhile, Apple CEO Tim Cook was summoned to appear on Capitol Hill after a Senate investigation found the company paid taxes in the U.S. of 2% on worldwide income of $74 billion. Accusing the head of one of the world's biggest companies of \"exploiting an absurdity,\" committee chairman Sen. Carl Levin made the connection between tax avoidance and efforts to cut the US deficit, and delivered a message that ought to resonate with taxpayers anywhere in the world. \"Because of those cuts, children across the country won't get early education. Needy seniors will go without meals. Fighter jets sit idle on tarmacs because our military lacks the funding to keep pilots trained,\" said Levin. \"The question each of us should ask today is this: Shouldn't we close unjustified tax loopholes, and dedicate the revenue to educating our children, protecting our nation and building its future?\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Simon Hooper."}

Dangerous wood-eating termites that can destroy trees and damage homes are the latest infestation to turn up in Florida. The Nasutitermes corniger termite are native to the Caribbean but have now joined the 20 or so other species of termites which live in the Sunshine State. The pesky insects are the latest unusual species found in Southern Florida along with African rats, Burmese pythons, and poisonous caterpillars. Not welcome: The Nasutitermes corniger termite, which is native to the Caribbean, have been found in southern Florida. They feast on hard wood and build tunnels up the outside of houses . The arrival of the termite poses a particular problem because they feast on hardwood, foraging on trees, garden furniture and attack the outside wall of homes. The termites differ from Florida's other species because they are found above ground and can fly - making it easier for them to establish new nests. As well as milllions of termites, Florida boasts a menagerie of animals you'd be best to avoid: . The so-called Sunshine state has four types of poisonous caterpillars whose sting can cause humans to pass out in pain. Beware the saddleback caterpillar, the puss caterpillar, the io caterpillar and the hag caterpillar. Southern Florida's crocodiles, which grow up to 14 feet, have multiplied 10-fold in the last 40 years. There are about 1,500 of the reptiles. A growing population of Burmese pythons are threatening to wipe out large numbers of raccoons, opossums and other small mammals in the Everglades area. Huge Gambian pouch rats, which grow up to nine pounds, have been found on Florida's Grassy Key despite efforts to eradicate them. Boa constrictors, Nile monitor lizards, and vervet monkeys have also wreaked havoc on local animal species. They build tunnels running up the outside of houses and trees where they create beach ball sized nests weighing up to 28 kilograms. And a single nest could hold more than a million termites, Rudolf H. Scheffrahn, professor of entomology at the University of Florida, told the Sun Sentinel. 'They love to eat hardwoods. They ate the handles off garden implements, rakes and hoes — turned them into shredded wheat. If this thing really keeps going, it's going to be a problem for tropical Florida, from West Palm Beach to the Keys,' warned Scheffrahn. He worries that the new species could increase the amount of termites in the Dania Beach region by as much as 30 per cent. But agricultural officials are determined to stamp out the plague of termites before they spread any further. Currently the species have only been spotted in 42 properties in Dania Beach. However, this translates to an infestation of up to 120 colonies meaning there are already 100 million in the area. Properties in Dania Beach were treated today in a bid to banish the insects although efforts to eradicate them will be spread over four days. 'They got into the tool shed and ate our stack of firewood,' resident Martha Rosen told the Sun Sentinel. 'We went to pick it up and there was no wood left. They're very aggressive. My trees look like they're almost dead,' she added. 'Out-of-control hysterical': The io caterpillar is one of four types of venomous caterpillars to release toxins with the slightest touch that can cause people to pass out from pain . 'On fire': A saddleback caterpilalr (pictured) has been known to bring the worst pain of the four kinds of stinging caterpillars in Florida that is like having a 'bee sting times a hundred' Last month venomous caterpillars that use their spines to attack were the latest threat to the region. Dr Jeffrey Bernstein, medical director of the Florida Poison Information Center in Miami, told the Sun-Sentinel newspaper that although the center has not seen any deaths from caterpillar stings, they have gotten hundreds of calls for help with people 'out-of-control hysterical.' 'It's a very painful sting,' Dr Bernstein told the newspaper. 'We even see people pass out from the pain.' The four types of caterpillars with the awful venom include the saddleback caterpillar, the puss caterpillar, the io caterpillar and the hag caterpillar. When they attack humans, the venom can be unbearable, particularly if the saddleback releases its poison. South Florida resident Michael Stanwyck told the Sun-Sentinel: It's like somebody lit you on fire.' He went on to say: 'A bee sting times a hundred.' The species is most threatening around this time of year in Florida as the weather starts to get warmer. Eggs begin to hatch and the caterpillars grow to become moths. Some people, although rare, can have an allergic reaction to the toxins. and are encouraged to call 911 or go to hospital. They can experience vomiting, shortness of breath and other reactions. Others with less severe attacks can be treated at home by calling Poison Control. Scotch tape can be placed over the wounded area and stripped off over and over again to remove the spines from within the skin. Although their poison is painful, the caterpillars are not looking to harm anyone or anything. Jaret Daniels, assistant professor of entomology at the University of Florida, told the Sun-Sentinel that they are merely trying to protect themselves. The venom is used as the caterpillars' predators, like birds and lizards. Mr Daniels said: If you're a caterpillar, you have a very challenging life because everything wants to eat you. 'They're not trying to hurt you. They're doing it to avoid being eaten.' Florida has become a popular new . home for interesting creatures, including crocodiles that can grow up to 14 feet long. Protection: The hag caterpilalr is also poisonous as it tries to protect itself from birds, lizards and other attackers that can eat them and prevent them from becoming a moth . Coexist: Officials urge people to leave the venomous species, like the puss caterpillar, alone as they are not trying to hurt people with their poison that could provoke an allergic reaction to humans . The reptiles have multiplied 10-fold in the last 40 years in south Florida with about 1,500 crocodiles. But now they face a new challenge in the area because most of the places they used to call home are now inhabited by humans. Humans in Florida also have to worry about huge pythons that are wiping . out the state's mammal populations. A . burgeoning population of Burmese . pythons — many of them pets that were turned loose by their owners when . they got too big — appears to be wiping out large numbers of raccoons, . opossums, bobcats and other mammals in the Everglades, according to a . study from the Proceeding of the National Academy of Sciences. Here to stay?: Once crocodiles decide on a place to live, it's difficult to get them to move meaning people in Florida might have to get used to having the species listed as 'threatened' by wildlife officials . The . study found that sightings of medium-size mammals are down . dramatically — as much as 99 percent, in some cases — in areas where . pythons and other large, non-native constrictor snakes are known to be . lurking. Scientists fear . the pythons could disrupt the food chain and upset the Everglades' environmental balance in ways difficult to predict. Another species that has threatened the state's environment are giant Gambian pouch rats that have . been found on Florida's Grassy Key despite concerted efforts . by conservation officials to eradicate them. Officials . worry that the voracious rats, which grow to nine pounds, might wipe . out some crops and upset the delicate ecological balance if they manage . to reach the Florida mainland. Another creature: Crocodiles aren't the only ones taking over in Florida as burmese pythons invaded the area . The Gambian rat first appeared on Grassy Key in 1999 after eight rats escaped from a local exotic pets breeder. 'We . thought we had them whipped as of 2009,' Scott Hardin, exotic-species . coordinator for the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, told . keysnet.com. 'In . the early part of 2011, a resident e-mailed me and said he saw one of . the rats. We were skeptical but went back and talked to people and [saw] . there were rats that we missed,' he added. Animals love Florida: African rats the size of cats have also taken up the warm state as their new home . Concern: Officials worry that the voracious rats, which grow to nine pounds, might wipe out some crops and upset the delicate ecological balance . After four female rats were found in . 2011, officials unsuccessfully launched another effort to kill them in November and . December, primarily through the use of poison-laced cantaloupe and . peanut butter. And it might become difficult to control crocodiles' interaction with humans if that population continues to grow. Crocodiles tend to stick to an area they decided they will live in now matter how much they have moved. So even if they leave a particular spot they chose as their own for weeks and travel far away, they are likely to return. They will likely continue to be one of the many species like boa constrictors, Nile monitor lizards, . vervet monkeys and more to join the state - and wreak havoc on local animal species."}

{"prompt": "A tech startup worth more than JetBlue and many other brand names might not even be real. High-flying Cynk Technologies has soared 30,000 per cent to more than $18 a share in the last month, raising its market value to more than $5billion. JetBlue, an established brand-name airline, is worth $3billion. Cynk is behind a social networking site called IntroBiz, which markets itself as a way to meet angel investors, celebrities, business owners and more. Off its highs: Cynk Technology hit more than $18 per share but has since fallen from that lofty perch under increased scrutiny . ‘Thru [sic] our marketplace you may both buy and sell the ability to socially connect to individuals such as celebrities, business owners, and talented IT professionals,’ the site boasts. Pictures of many celebrities including Angelina Jolie, Nicole Kidman, Johnny Depp and Leonardo DiCaprio are shown as ‘recent intros’ on the site’s homepage. It is not clear what has sent the stock literally climbing through the roof from six cents per share to more than $18 a share since June 16, there are signs trouble is afoot. Cynk’s headquarters is in Belize, the company is incorporated in Nevada and its only contact number is in Miami, Huffington Post noted. A MailOnline call to that number was not answered and disconnected after ringing more than 20 times. A filing earlier this year with the Securities and Exchange Commission said the company would not be able to file its annual report this year. ‘The Registrant is unable to file its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 within the prescribed time without unreasonable effort or expense because the Registrant and its accounting staff require additional time to complete the financial statements and the notes,’ said the filing. The social marketplace: Cynk promises to connect ordinary people with celebrities, tycoons and others on IntroBiz - but there is little proof to suggest anything is actually done . Video Source YouTube . A MailOnline call to the (800) number listed as the contact for Marlon Luis Sanchez resulted in a phone company message saying the number is unassigned. Sanchez is listed in the filing as the CEO, CFO, CAO, President, Secretary , Treasurer and Director of Cynk Technology. Cynk has only $39 in assets and almost $52,000 in liabilities, according to its most recent quarterly filing available on OTCMarkets.com. The company has lost money for several quarters and has no income, according to annual income statements available on Yahoo Finance. Bubbles come and go, but this company’s valuation defies logic. It is not clear what has driven the company’s shares to unfathomable heights – but a pump and dump scheme could be the culprit. Pump and dumps schemes work when brokers work to sell a penny stock - at six cents per share and trading over the counter, Cynk was a penny stock - to unsuspecting investors in order to drive the stock price up. Straw buyers also take positions in the stock, and sell their shares at a predetermined price where they realize a huge profit. Once they sell, the stock goes back down again and everyone else loses their shirt. Jordan Belfort, known as the 'Wolf of Wall Street' went to jail for a number of crimes including pump and dump schemes. SEC policy prohibits the agency from commenting on pending investigations, and a spokesperson would neither confirm nor deny the regulator is looking into the company."}
{"prompt": "By . Emma Innes . A fitness fanatic says he is in the best shape of his life despite eating McDonald’s for every meal for a month. Kai Sedgwick, 34, visited the fast food chain for breakfast, lunch and dinner for a month while he followed a tough workout regime. Mr Sedgwick, from Edinburgh, took up the challenge to see if he could eat burgers while getting into the best shape of his life. Kai Sedgwick, 34, carried out an experiment during which he ate only McDonald's while following a strict exercise regime for a month. He is pictured (left) before the experiment and (right) afterwards . Now, after finishing the challenge, he says he is as fit as he hoped he could become - but it’ll be a ‘long time’ before he eats a burger again. He said: ‘It was the hardest and loneliest month of my life, sitting alone eating my burgers. ‘My plan was to eat lots of McDonald’s and train really hard. It was one of the toughest things I’ve ever put myself through. ‘I was forgetting how good real food actually tastes. Anyone can eat a burger, but to eat one for nearly every meal for a month is really hard. ‘Food is meant to be a cultural experience, but after a while I realised I was eating for sustenance and not for the pleasure of the taste. ‘Now I’m finished, I don’t think I could eat another Big Mac for a very long time.’ Mr Sedgwick previously said he wasn’t a big fan of the food they serve McDonald’s and only went there about twice a year. But . over the last month he visited nine different outlets where he ate 99 . junk food meals, including 50 burgers, 45 crispy chicken wraps and . buckets of fries. Mr Sedgwick says he gained 2.7kg in muscle mass during the month-long experiment . His challenge set him back a whopping £366 - but he saved a further £55 by using vouchers. He took on 80,000 calories and expected to eat three kilos of fat as part of his daft diet, which he recorded on his blog. But his tough workout made sure that he ended up gaining 2.7kg in muscle mass during the experiment. After pumping iron, working a rowing machine and doing lots of running, he has lost a staggering 27 per cent of his body fat while he burnt 13,500 calories. Mr . Sedgwick said: ‘The first week was pretty tough when I started, but . after a while it just became routine going in to sit down and eat my . meal. ‘My . fitness is pretty good and I was quite surprised that I reached all the . fitness targets I set myself at the beginning of the month. ‘The hardest part was when I got the energy rush soon after eating from the calorie-rich food.’ He also added that he never even took his children along for a Happy Meal. Mr Sedgwick ate 99 junk food meals, including 50 burgers, 45 crispy chicken wraps and buckets of fries . He said: ‘I never told my kids what I was doing but eventually their mum told them. ‘I refused to take them with me while I was doing it, because I didn’t want them to get into any bad habits. ‘They had one with me at the end, but I wouldn’t let them come with me before that.’ But . despite making almost a hundred visits to McDonald’s, the restaurant . staff never even found out why he came to dine on a daily basis. He added: ‘The staff at my local McDonald’s didn’t learn my name. I think that’s because I never told them what I was doing. ‘I just went in with my headphones on and ordered my meal. ‘I’d imagine they’re probably a bit confused about why one of their most regular customers has stopped coming in though.' He said: \"I sent myself the task of eating every item on the McDonald's menu during the month and I managed to do that.\"In the morning I'd usually have a breakfast roll, hash browns and a coffee, and for lunch I'd have one of the burgers with fries and a Sprite Zero.\"For dinner I tended to either have a chicken wrap or salad with a small cheeseburger on the side to keep me going through the night.\" Mr . Sedgwick will now continue his workout regime but swap the ‘McDiet’ for . fresh fruit, vegetables and low fat foods in order to draw a comparison . by the end of June. He will also be recording how much money he spends in comparison and by the end of the two months. Following the experiment, it will be long time before he eats a burganr again, he says . Nutrionist Dr Chris Fenn, who has been monitoring Mr Sedgwick's 'McWorkout' challenge,  said: 'I've seen the photographs and Kai's six-pack does look impressive. It just shows you what a lot of exercise can do. 'He's worked hard to get the six-pack, but the workout would have been more effective if he had put decent food into his body. 'You can get away with eating junk once in a while, but he has gone to the extreme of eating it on a daily basis. 'One of the things he noticed was that his mood was changing and that he was starting to feel tired, lethargic and anxious. 'It's the wrong type of food which tends to clog up your cells and affects your brain activity. 'Another thing that was affected was his bowels, because McDonald's food contains hardly any fibre which is crucial to cleaning your digestive system. 'Once his blood results are in, there might be other results of toxins lurking in his body.'McDonald's would not comment on the workout project, but a spokeswoman added: 'At McDonald's, we serve good food made from quality ingredients. 'We offer our customers a range of menu options and provide clear nutrition information to help them make informed choices that are right for them.'"}

Australia (DIY) The easiest and cheapest method is applying online for an Electronic Travel Authority, a stampless visa ($17, eta.immi.gov.au). After completing a form that requires your passport details and a credit card, you can be approved in 30 seconds. You can also apply for an ETA in person at the embassy for free. Securing a visa by regular mail from the Washington, D.C., embassy is possible (austemb.org), but it costs $70 and takes two weeks. If you want help: The Australian government doesn't charge for visas arranged through expediters or travel agents, so all you'll have to pay is the company's fee. (PassportVisasExpress.com charges $20 for two-day processing.) Qantas agents can get you an electronic visa within 15 minutes for $25. Tour operators often handle visas, and some charge for the service. Newmans South Pacific Vacations will deduct its $25 processing fee if you take care of the visa yourself.

In San Francisco, visas are typically processed in five business days and can be sent to you via a U.S. Postal Service prepaid envelope, so bring one with you. In New York, visas are usually ready in 24 hours but must be picked up by someone. If you live near Chicago or D.C., you can apply by mail to those consulates. There's a $10 handling fee; allow at least three weeks. Most Brazilian consulates only accept U.S.P.S. money orders. And if you apply by mail, most require you to use U.S.P.S. Express Mail. China ($) Specialists charge $45-$55 on top of the $100 consular fee (up from $50 as of August 1) to get you a visa in about four days. If you book a package, the operator will take care of your application for $20-$30, shipping included. To save money: Apply in person or send a third party to the embassy in D.C., or the consulates in Chicago, Houston, L.A., New York City or San Francisco (china-embassy.org). There's no option to apply by mail, but visas will be mailed back to you if you supply a prepaid envelope. You should allow at least four business days for regular processing, or add an extra $30 for same-day service. Cashier's checks, money orders and cash are OK. Egypt (DIY) U.S. passport holders can pay $15 for a visa at the Cairo airport. Stop by the visa-payment booth before getting in line for immigration and customs. To apply in advance: You can apply by mail to an Egyptian consulate; allow a week or more for processing (egyptembassy.net). You can also go to the New York consulate and get a visa that day; the San Francisco one needs at least 24 hours for processing. Some consulates only take money orders and certified or cashier's checks. A visa specialist can get a visa in three days starting at $45. To save time: Travelers with Foreign Independent Tours and Misr Travel can pay an extra $20-$25 to have a staffer meet them at the Cairo airport with a prepaid visa sticker. That way, they can go directly to immigration. India (DIY) Beware the 15-day transit visa: It only costs $30, but the countdown begins the moment the consulate stamps the visa. Instead, opt for the $60, six-month tourist visa. If you're booking your trip through a tour operator or travel agent, ask them to deal with the visa. Many will do it for free -- all you have to pay is the fee (with a cashier's or certified check or a money order) and fill out the forms, which they can help with. The process takes about a week.

Cashier's checks and money orders only. If you want help: Expediters charge from $39 for seven-day processing, and $55 or so for four-day service. Russia ($) Beyond the $100 fee, tourist visas require proof of a Russia-based sponsor (often a tour operator). Expect to pay $45-$55 for assistance if your trip is booked through the operator, and more if you arranged your trip some other way. Alternately, Travel Document Systems charges $45 for 10-day processing. If you need a visa sooner, the fees go up, and the consulate tacks on charges: $50 for three- to five-day processing, $100 for next-day service, or $200 if you require same-day turnaround. To save money: You still need to show that you have a sponsor -- a hotel in Russia will do. Your hotel should have the standard tourist confirmation document that you need to submit with your applications. You'll need a confirmation document for each place you stay. Apply in person or by mail through a consulate, and be sure to include a prepaid return envelope; payment must be through cashier's check or money order (russianembassy.org). You should allow 6 to 10 business days for processing. Turkey (DIY) Pay $20 at the Istanbul airport visa booth before going to immigration. To apply in advance: Visas processed by mail cost $9 more and can take three weeks (turkishembassy.org). Consulates accept money orders and cashier's checks by mail and cash in person.

Vietnam (DIY) The prices and policies vary by consulate, and you need not apply via your regional office (vietnamembassy-usa.org). The San Francisco consulate charges $45 for three-day processing and $65 for next-day service. Others ask more -- four-day service from New York, for example, is $105. For D.C., include a prepaid U.S.P.S. Express Mail envelope. If you want help: PassportVisasExpress.com charges $89 for four-day service; Travel Document Systems charges $45 (7 to 10 days).

{"prompt": "By . Martin Beckford . PUBLISHED: . 17:03 EST, 21 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:03 EST, 21 December 2013 . A British woman with the mental age of a child was forced to marry a Pakistani immigrant and have his baby so that he could gain the right to live in Britain. A secret court heard that the 37-year-old, who has a reading age of seven, was slapped around the face by her mother to make her smile for her wedding photograph. The judge’s ruling, seen by The Mail on Sunday, reveals that fears were raised she was being ‘manipulated’ and her parents were being paid £20,000 to marry off their daughter to the Muslim student, who was facing deportation. Judgment: A British woman with the mental age of a child was forced to marry a Pakistani immigrant and have his baby so that he could gain the right to live in Britain, the court of protection was told . But despite concerns, registrars allowed the ceremony to go ahead and the woman’s husband, 33, is now using his human right to a family life as a reason to remain in the UK, despite the ‘grossly cruel’ ploy. The case came to light in the Court of Protection – which has the power to make life-or-death decisions on behalf of people deemed to lack mental capacity – and can be revealed today after an anonymised judgment was published. The judge in the case, Mrs Justice Parker, said: ‘I think there is a very significant possibility that this marriage was entered into, and indeed this child created, for reasons solely to do with immigration status.’ She added: ‘To put an incapacitated person in a position whereby she bears a child which she cannot look after is grossly cruel.’ The case has lifted the lid on the grim exploitation of people with severe mental health problems who are being ‘groomed’ and then forced into marriage for passports, money or free care. 'Grossly cruel': The court was told that the British woman had been married and divorced twice before. (Picture posed by model) Crime Prevention Minister Norman Baker told The Mail on Sunday last night: ‘To force anyone into  marriage without their consent or the capacity to consent is wrong and is a serious abuse of human rights.’ The court was told that the British woman, who had been a Sikh but later converted to Islam, had been married and divorced twice before. In 2011, she entered into a Muslim marriage with the man from Lahore, who was facing deportation after his student visa ran out and an appeal was rejected. She became pregnant ‘almost immediately’ and the following year they were about to have a civil wedding in a register office when social services tried to stop the ceremony. The UK Border Agency was also informed by registrars of suspicions that there was ‘money changing hands’ and the husband’s immigration status was the reason for the wedding. Registrars also said the woman was ‘confused about her husband’s name’ and spoke in a  ‘simplistic way’. The judge said ‘an anonymous informant’ had telephoned the register office to state that the woman’s father ‘had received £20,000 in consideration of the marriage’, but the judge added this was ‘hearsay’ and she could not establish if it was true. The woman’s family produced an opinion from a local doctor claiming that she did understand what marriage meant, but the judge said he ‘may have had some connection with the family’ and the doctor is now under investigation by a medical watchdog over the report. A senior registrar was ‘concerned about being seen not to have taken into account the cultural background and [the woman’s] right to marry and found a family’, according to the judge, so the ceremony was allowed to go ahead in February 2012.  During the event, the woman’s mother ‘slapped her on the face to get her to smile for a photograph’ and the registrar was ‘worried about her demeanour’. Mrs Justice Parker said it was  ‘difficult for me to be clear’ why the wedding was allowed to go ahead. She called for registrars to be given better guidance on how to spot the signs of people with learning disabilities being forced into marriage. The General Register Office is now considering the request. The couple went on to have a baby boy but social workers had to become involved as the mother  cannot look after him safely, the court heard. Carers who have lived with them painted a ‘worrying picture’ in which the husband is distant from his wife, rarely speaks to her and ‘walks ahead of her with the baby in his arms’. 'In reality another child': Mrs Justice Parker ruled that the woman in the case could not consent to sex, marriage or where she lived . The man told the court he now wants to be rehoused in a two-bedroom flat, with social workers visiting for two hours every morning and evening so he can ‘go to the mosque and also to pray at home’. ‘I was left with a very strong doubt as to what his true commitment and ability was to providing full-time seven-day care to the baby,’ the judge said. Mrs Justice Parker added the woman was ‘being used’ and was ‘in reality another child’. Last year, the woman suffered a broken jaw, supposedly by yawning, but the judge said that this was ‘most unlikely’. After the judge’s ruling that the woman could not consent to sex, marriage or where she lived, the husband and the baby are likely to be rehoused separately by the council. The couple’s marriage has not been annulled, nor have divorce proceedings begun, but the judge said that in the husband’s view ‘all pretence this is or could be a functioning marriage has now evaporated’. A total of 114 people with disabilities were helped by the Government’s Forced Marriage Unit last year, but it is feared this is just the tip of the iceberg. A new law is to make forced marriage illegal but cases involving people with learning disabilities rarely come to light, because the victims may be unable or unwilling to report the abuse. Human rights activist Mandy Sanghera said: ‘Forced marriage of people with learning disabilities is often hidden. We need to be clear about protection – we can’t let political correctness and cultural sensitivities get in the way of this.’ Although the judge ordered that none of those involved can be named to preserve the anonymity of the woman, in other cases the parties have been identified. Critics said it meant the registrars, who faced criticism for not stopping the wedding, could not be held to account."}

The fitness guru, who first made her fortune after opening a chain of luxury gyms, admitted earlier this year that her spacious wardrobe had just continued to get bigger and bigger and confessed that there was no real limit to its expansion. 'It started years ago when I had a closet party and all the girls came over and they said, \"I just wish it was bigger,\"' she told the Houston Chronicle 'Since then it's just been getting bigger and bigger and bigger, it's like a \"she cave.\"' In August, Ms Roemer's closet-turned-cave hit the headlines after a burglar broke into the space and stole a selection of her most expensive accessories, handbags and jewelry, including a priceless locket which contains a piece of her late son's hair.

'I'm a woman of my word, and I told everyone this closet was built for fundraising and that's what it's intended for,' Ms Roemer told ABC Eyewitness News in November. 'Why would I let someone who wasn't invited to my home ruin that?'

Gary Glitter’s mansion was a ‘magical place’ for little girls, with a room full of sweets, a swimming pool and ponies to pet, his rape trial heard yesterday. The former glam rock singer is said to have had shelves stacked with jars of goodies for children and let teenage girls keep their horses at his sprawling countryside home. Yesterday a woman who has accused the 70-year-old of trying to rape her when she was eight, told how she initially felt ‘really lucky’ to be invited to his house. She told Southwark Crown Court she thought the mansion was ‘magical’ when he first drove her there in his Rolls-Royce in the 1970s. ‘Everything smelt new, there was loads of corridors and everything was really plush,’ she said. ‘There was a swimming pool.’ The woman, who is now a nurse, told jurors she enjoyed eating treats in his ‘sweet room’, saying: ‘You went inside and there were loads of jars on shelves with different types of sweets.’ Earlier, John Price, QC, prosecuting, said: ‘To a little girl it must have seemed a magical place.’ The primary pupil also went to parties attended by Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, and fellow rocker Alvin Stardust, the court heard. But after one dinner party, Glitter is alleged to have sneaked into bed with her and a friend and attempted to rape her. Yesterday, she sobbed as she recalled the alleged assault which left her in pain, and feeling ‘ashamed and dirty’. Scroll down for video . In court: A sketch by artist Elizabeth Cook of Glitter appearing at Southwark Crown Court on Monday. Glitter is said to have crept into a youngster's bed and tried to assault her . But jurors heard Glitter showed no remorse and taunted her about it years later, saying: ‘Do you remember what I did to you?’ Giving evidence from behind a screen, the woman, now in her 40s, told how she woke to find him in bed between her and her friend. ‘I just knew it was him. He smelled of alcohol and the party. I rolled completely on my side away from him then he rolled over toward me. He put his arm around and started to cuddle me.’ She said she felt ‘uncomfortable’, but didn’t want to be ‘rude’. Choking back tears, she added: ‘He started moving my nightie up. I didn’t want him to.’ Glitter (centre) arrives with two other men he got out of a car with for his trial in central London yesterday . Musician: Glitter - Paul Gadd - is a former rock star . The assault stopped only when the girl managed to roll into a ‘cocoon’ of sheets separating her from Glitter, the court heard. But the next day he acted ‘normal’ and gave her chocolate, it was alleged. Years later, she said, she saw him at another party, where he invited her to a bedroom and asked her to give ‘Uncle Gary’ a cuddle on the bed. ‘He put his arms around me and rolled me so I’m sort of lying beside him. I was just extremely uncomfortable. 'Then he asked if I remembered what he had done to me. He kind of laughed and asked if I had liked it.’ Terrified, the teenager refused his advances and left the flat, the court was told. But jurors heard that she did not go to the police until 1998 when she heard that Glitter had been arrested for amassing a hoard of child pornography. Glitter denies one count of attempted rape, seven of indecent assault, one of administering a drug or other substance and one of sex with a girl aged under 13. The trial continues.

{"prompt": "By . Becky Barrow . More than 12,000 retired public sector workers enjoy pensions worth 'in excess of £50,000 a year', a report reveals today. Of those, nearly 150 have retired on incomes worth more than £100,000 a year. The research lays bare the pensions enjoyed by high-earning members of the state sector  workforce – dubbed Britain's 'pensions aristocracy'. The study also claims that the true cost of pension promises made to current public sector workers is a massive £1,700billion – around £600billion higher than the Government's own estimate. A report has laid bare the pensions enjoyed by high-earning members of the state sector  workforce . It is the equivalent of an extra £35,000 bill for every tax-paying household in the country with occupants below retirement age. The report was written by former Bank of England economist Neil Record, and compiled by the Intergenerational Foundation, a Left-leaning think tank that examines fairness between the generations. Angus Hanton, co-founder of the Foundation, said: 'The relationship between those making these promises today and those who will pay later is one-sided.' He warns the bill for pensions, which he warned is 'an enormous Ponzi scheme', will be 'paid for in the future largely by our children and grandchildren.' This is because there is no  precise pot of money set aside for the majority of public sector workers' pensions, such as those in the NHS, teachers and civil service. Instead, it relies on new workers joining the State workforce and  paying into their pension to help pay the retirement benefits of those who have retired. The report was compiled by former Bank of England economist, now a multimillionaire, Neil Record . Retired state workers are 'rewarding . themselves huge pensions with scant regard to the interests of their . younger colleagues, many of whom will be funding their older colleagues' pensions until 2050,' according to the report. Mr . Record added: 'Rewarding an older generation at the hidden and . unrecognised expense of a younger generation until it is too late is . morally indefensible.' To . get a pension worth £100,000 a year, a private sector worker would need . to build a pension pot of around £2.8million, assuming he or she wants . to retire at the age of 65  and have a pension which increases with . inflation every year and passes to their spouse if they die first. Laith Khalaf, head of corporate research at the financial advisers Hargreaves Lansdown, said: 'Few people could ever dream of having a pension of this size.' By comparison, the average  pension pot is worth just £35,000, and pays out only £1,200 a year. Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance campaign group, said: 'The scale of the public sector pension liability is enormous, much scarier than the Government lets on. 'The situation has rapidly deteriorated over the last decade and will only get worse with an ageing population, meaning our debt mountain will continue to grow.' Since 1997, the number of private sector workers with a 'defined benefit' pension has collapsed from 4.9million to just 1.7million today, according to the Office for National Statistics. A 'defined benefit' pension is one which guarantees to pay a certain pension to a worker when he or she retires, such as a final salary pension or a career average pension. The Coalition has also dramatically clamped down on public sector pensions. As a result, workers must pay more into their pension and retire at a later age – but still enjoy far more generous pensions than the majority of private sector employees. A Treasury spokesman said: 'The Government's reforms to public service pensions will save £430billion over the next 50 years and ensure they are affordable and sustainable in the long-term. 'Reformed public service pensions will remain among the very best available, whilst rebalancing the costs more fairly between employees, employers and the taxpayer.'"}

A man has caused outrage after finding the world's oldest message in a bottle - and refusing to open it. Worn and battered, but still sealed, the elusive note has finally reached a reader - 1,115 miles and one century later. The green glass artefact was spotted sitting on the shore of the secluded Schooner's Cove in Tofino, Canada. The envelope, visible through the bottle, shows Earl Willard's address and where the letter was sent from . Strolling along the recently excavated beach on Monday morning, Steve Thurber noticed the bottle lying in the middle of an open stretch of sand. The note inside is signed by Earl Willard, who was 76 hours into a boat trip from San Francisco to Bellingham, Washington, when he 'posted' his note. It was a route that would take him around 10 days to two weeks if the ship stuck to its schedule. Hailing from a day when the delivery of . cross-country letters was something of a Russian roulette, the Earl will never have known if his note arrived. But Mr Thurber has infuriated people worldwide by refusing to open the letter. Determined to preserve what has stayed intact since September 29 1906, he has decided to leave the details of the message shrouded in mystery. All that can be read through the bottle - the cap of which is rusted over - is the date it was thrown into the sea, September 29 1906 and that it is signed by Earl Willard. It lists Willard's address and states that he was a passenger on a steamer from San Francisco to Washington and that he threw the bottle into the sea 76 hours into the voyage. The 107-year-old bottle was nestled in the sand of Schooner's Cove in Tofino, Canada . Outcry: Steve Thurber has infuriated people by refusing to open the artefact as a way to preserve it . Mystery, however, surrounds what the envelope inside contains - but Mr Thurber is refusing to open the bottle. He said: 'Maybe there was only one bottle that the guy sent out and I found it. It is like a one in a billion chance.' Online comments about the bottle include many from people who have seen local news reports in Canada, with a poster called Carol writing: 'WTF was the message?' Emily wrote: 'How can he not open it?' 'I hope they open it because it was meant to be read one day,' wrote Kevin Mackie. At 107 years old - almost to the day - the bottle looks set to be named the oldest ever found. The previous Guinness World Record for a message in a bottle was 98 years after Scottish fisherman Andrew Leaper found a bottle in Shetland last year. The bottle in Scotland contained a postcard offering a reward of sixpence to the finder. Mr Thurber added: 'I guess it is a chance that you find something that somebody sent out into the water.

Ranked 271st in the world, he completed his third successive round of 66, this time at the tough Carnoustie course, to be on 18-under-par 198 and in pole position for the $785,000 first prize. The joint halfway leader fired five birdies and an eagle, while compatriot McDowell carded 67 at St. Andrews to be one shot clear of 2010 British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen. Hollywood A-listers hit the greens . \"Michael has always been a very talented player,\" McDowell said. \"He's a great ball-striker, has a great swing. He has always had the talent and won the British Amateur in 2001 before playing on a winning Walker Cup side. \"It's a fine line between guys who go on to become the best in the world and guys who become journeymen pros. And you wouldn't say Michael is a journeyman, he's popped up twice and won on tour, and won well each time.\" South Africa's Oosthuizen shot 69 at St. Andrews to be one ahead of Northern Ireland's reigning U.S. Open champion Rory McIlroy. World No. 3 McIlroy carded 66, also at the home of golf, to be tied for fourth with a group of seven players including world No. 1 Luke Donald and three-time major winner Padraig Harrington of Ireland. Donald fired a flawless nine-birdie round of 63 to tie McIlroy's 2010 course record at St. Andrews, as did Simon Dyson, with both Englishmen in final-day contention five shots behind Hoey. Masters champion Charl Schwartzel was tied for 11th after a 66 at St. Andrews, while world No. 2 Lee Westwood was another shot back on 205 after a 68 at the same course. Northern Ireland's current British Open champion Darren Clarke this week admitted he is struggling for motivation following his breakthrough major triumph in July, and that languor continued as he carded 70 at St. Andrews to be 19 shots off Hoey's pace. Hoey was also in the running in the pro-am section, as he and U.S. businessman William Farish Jr. were a shot behind England's Nick Dougherty and UK broadcaster Chris Evans. Dyson, paired with former chart-topping pop star Huey Lewis, was third. Actor Hugh Grant was tied for 56th, while Hollywood heavyweight Michael Douglas was joint 100th as he played with veteran eight-time European No. 1 Colin Montgomerie. The 2010 Ryder Cup-winning captain was 18th in the main event after a 66."}

{"prompt": "New York (CNN) -- Democratic Congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy of New York -- who ran for office after a gunman killed her husband and injured her son -- is drafting legislation that would ban the sale of high-capacity gun ammunition magazines to civilians in the aftermath of the tragic shooting in Tucson, Arizona. \"What we're looking at is high-capacity magazines and nothing else,\" McCarthy Press Secretary Shams Tarek told CNN, explaining the legislation would be streamlined to maximize odds of passage. A prohibition on the sale of ammunition magazines containing more than 10 bullets was part of the federal assault weapons ban that expired in 2004. \"We're hoping to introduce it this week,\" said Tarek. The alleged gunman in Tucson fired a Glock semi-automatic handgun with a clip reportedly having the capacity for 31 rounds. Only after the gunman's ammunition was spent and he tried to reload were bystanders able to tackle and restrain him, according to the Pima County Sheriff. \"The most immediate and obvious thing to do is ban high-capacity magazines. There's no reason for a civilian to have it,\" said Daniel Vice, senior attorney at the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence. \"It would have saved people from being shot.\" The alleged shooter, Jared Lee Loughner, 22, was scheduled to appear in a Phoenix, Arizona, courtroom Monday afternoon, according to prosecutors. Loughner is accused of opening fire outside a Tucson supermarket where Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Arizona, was meeting with constituents Saturday. Six people were killed -- including a federal judge -- and 14 others, including Giffords who was shot in the head, were wounded in the shooting. Six states and the District of Columbia currently ban the sale of high-capacity gun magazines, according to the Brady Center: California, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York."}

{"prompt": "This month, the Supreme Court will deliver a hotly anticipated decision on whether for-profit companies should have to comply with the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive care rule. The companies that appeared before the court in March, Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood Specialties, cited religious grounds in objecting to providing female employees birth control without a co-pay. But there's another issue in this case that, as a physician, I feel merits more attention: the importance and indeed revolutionary nature of the rule. Between 2007 and 2011, my colleagues and I conducted a study that shows that improving access to contraception promises to reduce our nation's unintended pregnancy and abortion rates dramatically. It isn't hard to understand why. Birth control lets women determine whether and when to have children. But that's not all. Women also need contraceptive care for other medical reasons, such as preventing ovarian or uterine cancer and regulating painful periods. There's a reason why the Affordable Care Act includes contraceptive care at no cost to the individual -- it's basic health care. We also know that cost is a factor in what contraception women use. Nearly one-third of women say they would change their contraception method if cost were not an issue. So what happens when cost is no longer an issue? That's what we tested during the Contraceptive CHOICE Project. During this long-term study, we offered more than 9,000 women the reversible contraceptive method of their choice while at the same time improving their knowledge of contraceptive methods and eliminating the most common barriers women face: cost and access. The results demonstrated the extraordinary promise of giving women the tools they need to control their reproductive lives. Three quarters of women chose the most effective methods of contraception: intrauterine devices and implants. This figure radically differs from the contraception chosen by women in the current landscape. Far fewer women in the general population use these methods, in large part because they are expensive. Our study suggests that when we remove cost barriers and improve education and access, as would be the case with full implementation of the contraceptive rule, we have the potential to make an astounding impact on the public health of women in our country. Wouldn't it be great if an unintended consequence of this mandate was a reduction in the number of unintended pregnancies and the need for abortions? Meeting the contraceptive needs of women will never be achieved when all methods of birth control are not equally accessible to every woman."}
{"prompt": "New York (CNN) -- Staring down a smoking homemade bomb and dismantling it is dangerous enough. Doing it with news cameras rolling on a busy Saturday night in the middle of Times Square is something Det. Patrick LaScala of the New York Police Department swears never entered his mind. Until the following day. \"You're home the next day, and you're really thinking about it. Then, you start to put the pieces together and you think, 'Wow,' \" LaScala said in an exclusive interview. LaScala was manipulating the police robot that laid the groundwork for one of his partners, Det. Raymond Clair. \"This was the first time that I went down on a vehicle, and I saw clocks and wires and gas and propane. I identified it as a bomb, and I had to look twice,\" Clair said. After 13 years as a bomb tech, that night was the one Clair says he'll remember the most. Clair and LaScala are part of New York's elite bomb squad, a unit whose size is a closely guarded secret. CNN was given special access to the unit in order to find out what a more typical day can be like. During one recent 16-hour shift, I watched the same five-man team who worked the bungled bomb plot in Times Square check their equipment, catch up on paperwork and make sure Dan-O, their explosives-sniffing dog, was raring to go. The K-9 is named for a member of the squad who died in the 9/11 attacks when one of the twin towers collapsed. On a busy side street outside their Manhattan offices, neighbors watched them go through their paces with the robot. \"We think they're great,\" one man said. Another passerby snapped a picture of the robot with her cell phone. \"Is that the robot that checks out bombs?\" she asked. It was. But robots, as sophisticated as they are, can only do so much. They're capable of blowing out windows, blasting a suspicious package to bits, photographing an object from several angles and sending those images to investigators. The squad doesn't want to publicize more specific details. Still, a human touch often can't be avoided. With help, bomb techs first crawl into an 85-pound protective suit that covers their bodies from head to toe. The feet nearly look like those of a platypus, the material is stiff and hot, and the chest plate is heavy. A helmet is cinched on around the neck, and an air hose keeps outside air flowing into the mask. Put on gloves, and it's hard to imagine that anyone in such bulky gear could maneuver and dismantle possible bomb components. But that's what they're trained to do. \"The more you do, and the more you get involved, the better you'll get when it's the real thing,\" Clair said. Det. Greg Abbate also was there for the \"real thing\" in Times Square. He said his training kicked in. \"There's a strong bond between us. We go to a job, there's very little talk. Everyone knows what they have to do,\" he said. Despite the immense dangers associated with the work, whenever the unit checks out a suspicious package, bomb technicians jockey for the opportunity to suit up. \"We actually have arguments over who's taking the job,\" added Abbate. When CNN traveled with them on a call, it was Abbate's turn to wear the gear. The bomb squad was called to check out a backpack found in a park near a police headquarters checkpoint. The team sped to the scene with sirens screaming. Other units ringed the perimeter. X-rays were taken. Abbate moved in. This time, he determined that this time, there was nothing to it. Sgt. John Ryan said it's necessary to assume the worst until the team moves in. \"Everything is a bomb until we say it's not a bomb, \" said Ryan. The days are long, but the men say they feel \"blessed\" to be part of the bomb squad. They laugh when people suggest they must be a little crazy to do such a dangerous job. \"It's an honor,\" LaScala said. And it never gets old. \"At the end of the day, it's just one day down and a lot more to go,\" said Det. Mike Garcia. CNN producers Julian Cummings and Ross Levitt contributed to this report."}

His widow Patti, who has openly blamed the lung disease on his smoking, spoke about how Everly had to carry oxygen tanks with him wherever he went in his last years. Although Everly quit smoking in 2001, the habit had done permanent damage to his lungs and he started experiencing problems that eventually ended his singing career in 2004. At his last public appearance in 2011, at Buddy Holly's induction to Hollywood Boulevard's Star Walk of fame, Everly was struggling to catch his breath as he addressed the crowd. 'It went from mild COPD to severe. He skipped medium,' Patti Everly told The Tennessean. 'When I met him, he was 55 and taking nothing but vitamins. By the end he was taking 20 medications, and hooked up to oxygen 24/7, carrying it with him.'

He fought long and hard.' The Everly Brothers were best known for their steel-string guitar playing and close vocal harmonies and dominated charts on both sides of the Atlantic in the late 1950s and early 60s. Their biggest hits included Wake Up Little Susie, All I Have To Do Is Dream and Bye Bye Love. Their unique vocal style directly influenced The Beatles – who even referred to themselves early in their career as 'the English Everly Brothers'. The Everly Brothers still hold the record for the most top 100 singles by any duo in history. During the height of their success, the crooners charted nearly three dozen hits on the Billboard Hot 100. The pair broke up on stage in 1973 and reportedly did not speak to each other for a decade except at their father's funeral. They got back together at a reunion concert at London's Royal Albert Hall in 1983 and three years later were among the first acts to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."}

A jealous boyfriend killed his own baby daughter, her mother and grandmother after torching their home on the day the child was released from hospital, a murder trial has heard today. Carl Mills, 29, is accused of killing three generations of the same family after setting their home ablaze. Kayleigh Buckley, 17, six-month-old daughter Kimberley and grandmother Kim, 46, were all trapped in their home when it was engulfed in flames. Newport Crown Court heard how Mills started the fire after he became convinced Kayleigh had another man in her bedroom. But the only people inside were the family - who were celebrating Kimberley’s homecoming after being born prematurely at just 1lb 9ozs in hospital. Neighbours saw Kayleigh banging on the windows and screaming for help but they were unable to save her. Prosecutor Greg Bull said: 'The three victims didn’t have a chance.' He said they were unable to get down the stairs because of where the fire was set. He said: 'Within minutes it became impossible to save the people inside. Neighbours did all the right things but they were confronted with a scene which can only be described as heartbreaking. 'Kayleigh was in the window of a smoke-filled room crying for help for her and her baby. 'People were calling out “Jump” but she wouldn’t leave her baby. Neighbours could hear her saying she was on fire. 'Then within a few minutes there was silence. All of the victims died in the fire.' The court heard Mills (left) started the fire after he became convinced Kayleigh (right) had another man in her bedroom . The court heard the only people in the house were grandmother Kim (left, with granddaughter Kimberley), Kayleigh and the six-month-old baby, who had just returned from hospital after being born prematurely . The court heard how Kayleigh met Mills when she was 15 on the internet - he was living in Manchester and travelled to her home in Cwmbran, South Wales. Mr Bull said: 'He deliberately set out to groom her sexually. Their relationship developed into a sexual one. He seemed to exercise a magnetic control over Kayleigh. 'Mills became obsessively jealous of Kayleigh. He became obsessed she was involved with other boys.' The court heard Kayleigh became pregnant with twins born in March of last year. Prosecutor Greg Bull said Mills became 'obsessively jealous of Kayleigh' after they met on the internet . One twin, Angel, died at just two days after being born weighing 15 oz but doctors were able to save Kimberley who weighed 1lb 9oz. The baby was named after her gran who gave up her job as an Avon lady to help raise her. Mr Bull said: 'Kayleigh started acting as a mother and that was one of the factors which caused this violent crime. 'Mills didn’t want Kayleigh to spend more time with the baby. He wanted Kayleigh to be with him and him alone. He become convinced she was having an affair with another man.' 'Kayleigh was in the window of a smoke-filled room crying for help for her and her baby. People were calling out “Jump” but she wouldn’t leave her baby' - Prosecutor Greg Bull . Mills was not invited to the homecoming of baby Kim when she was allowed out of the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport. The court heard he had been threatening and controlling for months - and had been banned from the family home. But Mills wouldn’t leave Kayleigh alone and was sleeping in a tent in front of the family home. The family home was decorated with balloons and banners for Kimberley - but the court heard Mills allegedly flew into a rage. The court heard texts were sent by Mills to Kayleigh on the night before she died. One said 'I’ll burn your house down', while another read 'I hope you f****** get burnt'. Another text read 'You lot made a mistake, a very bad mistake,' while a further text said 'Sleep with one eye open you dirty s***'. The court heard Mills started the fire in the porchway of the three-bed house . His fingerprints were found on a welcome home banner which he had ripped down on the night of the fire in September last year. The court heard how he also sent a string of messages taunting Kayleigh about the balloons outside the house - which the prosecution claim places him at the scene. In the messages he threatens Kayleigh who he believes has another man in the house, saying he will cut off electricity to the house, then set fire to it, the court heard. He also explains how he wants to blow up the oxygen cylinders there to help little Kimberly with her lung problems. The court heard how Kayleigh's mother Kim (pictured) did not like Mills but made efforts to include him in the family . Mr Bull told how Mills started the fire in the porchway of the three-bed house - and the fire quickly spread. He said: 'The fire extended rapidly and the stairs were soon breached and the door gave way. It created a fireball into the roof which burned down into the bedroom. 'The house was well ablaze. The fire service tried to enter but it was too ferocious. As this mayhem was developing, along came Mills. 'Neighbours were shocked by how calm he appeared to be. He showed no emotion and did not attempt to rescue his daughter or the woman he claimed to love. 'It was the actions of a cold-hearted killer who knew exactly what he was doing. He had carried out the threat he had made hours earlier.' Mills, of no fixed abode, denies three charges of murder. The court heard how Kayleigh’s mother Kimberley did not like Mills but made efforts to include him in the family. Mr Bull said: 'Kim was frightened of Mills who she thought was unpredictable and threatening. 'He had violent mood swings and often threatened to do harm to them. Kim tried to involve Mills but he became more controlling of Kayleigh. His behaviour was abusive and irrational.' The court heard how two weeks before the murders, Mills had 'trashed' the family home while baby Kimberley was still in hospital. He was reported to police for criminal damage while the family were out of their home in Cwmbran. The court heard grandmother Kim was given guardianship rights over the baby and Mills was not allowed to see her unsupervised. Mr Bull said: 'Mills would not have access on his own to the baby and this caused hatred and resentment to Kim and Kayleigh. 'There were threats to both of them by setting their house on fire. Mills told Kim in a text message that he was going to burn her from the earth.' Mr Bull said the threats reached a peak on the night baby Kimberley was due home. The jury was told that Mills wouldn't leave Kayleigh (pictured) alone and was sleeping in a tent in front of the family home . Mr Bull said: 'It was meant to be a day of great joy and celebration.' But the court heard it became one of tragedy after Mills repeatedly accused Kayleigh of having another man in the house. He said: 'For a considerable period of hours the text messages show Mills getting more and more frustrated by Kayleigh. He was obsessive and jealous, assuming she was sleeping with someone else.' The court heard he repeatedly texted 'Bring him out' before the arson attack at around 3.30am - just six hours after his baby arrived home. The trial continues.

{"prompt": "Lawmakers are fuming over President Barack Obama's admission on Thursday that his White House lacks a strategy for dealing with the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) in Syria, with one congressman comparing his performance to the bumbling sheriff's deputy Barney Fife from 'The Andy Griffith Show.' And as House and Senate members piled on with sharp criticism, a former senior aide to a retired defense secretary told MailOnline that the Joint Chiefs of Staff are 'seeing red' and 'spitting nails' following Obama's candid admission. 'They're losing confidence in their mission,' said the long-time Pentagon insider, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 'When the president doesn't know what direction to point people in, all his advisers can do is guess at what he wants. That's not good.' Texas Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert told Fox News.on Thursday that Obama articulated 'a pitiful foreign policy, and Barney Fife is in charge,' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . No strategy: Obama said Thursday that he hasn't settled on a direction in Syria as ISIS solidifies its bases there despite losing ground to US airstrikes in Iraq . 'Barney Fife is in charge': A Texas congressman slammed Obama, likening him to Don Knotts' 1960s character Barney Fife (left), a scatter-brained sheriff's deputy on The Andy Griffith Show . 'I don't know where he's getting his information,' said Gohmert. 'Maybe it's CIA Director [John] Brennan who said earlier this year that \"No, these guys don't want a caliphate\".' 'He must have his head buried in a hole somewhere on the first green.' As Washington scratched its collective head, the president headed on the road Friday for a political fundraising trip. 'I don't want to put the cart before the horse,' Obama had said Thursday, referring to the thorny problem of whether to attack ISIS inside Syria's borders. 'We don't have a strategy yet.' 'We need to make sure we've got clear plans, and we're developing them,' the president said. 'At that point I will consult with Congress and make sure their voices are heard.' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest scrambled to mop up after the ill-timed gaffe on Twitter, saying Obama 'was explicit – as he has been in the past – about the comprehensive strategy that we'll use to confront' ISIS. He repeated that word – 'comprehensive' – in a hastily arranged appearance on CNN. On Friday he told reporters that the Obama administration isn't going to walk back the president's choice of words, but was concerned about 'the way it was being reported' by news outlets. A reporter from CNN had challenged him, saying that 'the fact that you came out so quickly and tried to explain what the president had to say suggests that what he said was not what he intended to say.' Earnest said the Pentagon is 'developing' a strategy to 'confront some of the challenges there.' Karl Rove, a deputy chief of staff in the George W. Bush White House, said Thursday night on Fox News that he was 'appalled' by the president's 'we don't have a strategy' moment. 'He was warned about the role that ISIS was playing inside Syria, and he has had all that time to develop a strategy about what to do about ISIS in Syria – and he still doesn't,' Rove said. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers said on CNN that Obama's appearance Thursday 'was an odd press conference at the very best, but to have a press conference to say we don't have a strategy was really shocking given the severity of the threat.' Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan, the Republicans' vice presidential nominee in 2012, said Thursday night, in California said the U.S. needs a 'strategy to finish [ISIS] off.' 'Not to contain them ... but to fundamentally finish them off,' Ryam said. 'And I don't think the president sees this moment for what it is.' Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell urged Obama 'to exercise some leadership' and determine a plan for eradicating ISIS that Congress can support. The president mentioned four times on Thursday his intention to seek advice from Congress before deploying more military assets in the Middle East, likely in response to concerns from members of the House and Senate that he was unconstitutionally freezing them out. But 'there's no point in me asking for action on the part of Congress,' Obama told the press corps, 'before I know exactly what it is that is going to be required for us to get the job done.' Taking over: This undated image posted on a militant website shows fighters from ISIS marching in Raqqa, Syria . Clad in a muted tan suit that drew as many comments on Twitter as the content of his remarks, he emphasized that he is mainly focused now on pushing back ISIS in Iraq, where American military jets and drones have executed more than 100 airstrikes this month. But he boasted that America could put down the ISIS threat in Syria – at least in the short-term – at a time of his choosing. 'As I've said before – I think I said it in the previous press conference,' he said, 'our military is the best in the world.' 'We can rout ISIL on the ground and keep a lid on things temporarily, he insisted, referring to ISIS by the White House's preferred name. 'But then as soon as we leave, the same problems come back again.' 'My priority at this point is to make sure that the gains that ISIL made in Iraq are rolled back and that Iraq has the opportunity to govern itself effectively and secure itself,' the president said. The vicious terrorist group has its most comfortable stronghold in Syria, leaving open the possibility that defeating them in Iraq could leave them more entrenched one nation to the west – in a country that shares a hotly contested border with Israel, a key U.S. ally. The administration has green-lighted surveillance flyovers across portions of eastern Syria in recent days to assess ISIS's numbers and evaluate potential military targets. Horror: Video emerged Thursday showing ISIS militants marching 250 Syrian soldiers, lad only in their underwear, to a mass execution near the key northern Tabqa air base . Gathering strength: ISIS captured this munitions warehouse in Raqqa, Syria on Sunday . White House aides have leaked to a variety of news outlets the idea that Obama is considering striking ISIS in Syria despite objections from the country's dictator, Bashar al-Assad. Syria is in general disarray as rebels from a range of moderate and militant Islamist groups have fought a civil war for more than three years with the aim of taking over the country. ISIS is among the groups that oppose Assad. Crushing them could strengthen the barbaric regime in Damascus, and vice versa. Dealing with that conundrum 'is going to be a long-term project,' Obama said. 'It's going to require us to stabilize Syria in some fashion' but identifying moderate Sunni Muslims who can govern the country. Expanding his Iraq campaign to a second country, though, could highlight his administration's failure to intervene a year ago after Obama warned Assad about the consequences of crossing a 'red line' by deploying chemical weapons against the rebels. He said Thursday that he has directed Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and the military's Joint Chiefs of Staff 'to prepare a range of options' for him."}

Definitely not for the squeamish, it shows Mr ‘Gross’ removing what is quite possibly the world’s longest ingrown hair. The video begins with ‘Gross’ claiming, maybe not for the first time, that this is the grossest thing he’s ever done. Joe Gross lines up the clump of ingrown hair on his neck with his tweezers . After clamping the tweezers around the clump of hair he gives it a good tug . ‘I’ve had this giant black mark on my face for months and it literally looks like a pound of hair,’ he said. Then, using a pair of pink tweezers to make the whole procedure a little more stylish, he starts pulling the clump of black hair from his cheek. What goes on from here is pretty hard to stomach as Gross goes on to live up to his name and gets to work on removing the hair. There must be a lot of horror fans out there in cyberspace as the video has gone viral. During the disgusting drama Gross describes how he had a pimple which would ooze every couple of months for about a year. The hair comes out slowly in long strands that seem to take ages to come out . He finally pulls the last piece of hair out using the tweezers leaving only a hole and specks of blood . A dermatologist made it clear to him that it was a cyst that would need to cut out, but as the hair just kept on being pulled out it ended up being just ‘the longest ingrown hair in history.’ Equally revolting was the moment a Canadian man last month squeezed a spot on the back of his neck for the first time in 20 years, and a torrent of white pus that had been blocked under the skin for two decades was released.

'After an emergency meeting of the Board of Directors, EPO has decided not to appoint referees from Monday (17 November) following the murderous attack on a member of the KED/EPO, hence the indefinite postponement of all matches in all divisions in order to protect those involved,' EPO said in a statement.

Zografos, a former FIFA referee, works under retired Scottish referee Hugh Dallas, who was appointed head of the KED in the close season after continued pleas from Greek clubs for a foreign official to take on the administrative role following several match-fixing scandals in recent seasons. Matches have already been suspended once this season by the government in late September as a mark of respect following the death of a fan after violent clashes at a third division match. Ethinikos Piraeus supporter Kostas Katsoulis, 46, suffered serious head injuries following clashes with Irodotos fans in Crete during the match on Sept. 15. Vital Information . Olympiakos Piraeus president Evangelos Marinakis said he had vital information about the attack on Zografos which he would give to the police and Greek soccer chiefs and he called on all stakeholders in Greek football to put a stop to violence.

'I went to the meeting to discuss names and say what I've learned from my colleagues and collaborators about this murderous act,' former Super League president Marinakis added. 'We are talking about human lives here, it's no longer about an insult, or bitter comments which are said on the radio or television in the heat of the moment; we are talking about a murderous attack on the man that is very lucky to be alive.' Marinakis also said he was available to help police with their enquiries into the incident and made references to evidence of threatening behaviour towards referees which he said was rife in the lower divisions.

The only other person aboard the yacht was Alix Tichelman, 27, who will be tried for manslaughter, drug charges and prostitution on February 23. She is pleading not guilty. And the entire case hangs on a video of the entire night. It took three months and a court order to obtain the footage - which changed everything. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Intense detail: Police describe a video that allegedly shows high-end escort Alex Tichelman, 27, (left) giving Forrest Hayes, 51, (right) a lethal dose of heroin aboard his yacht, before 'cleaning up and walking out' Pleading not guilty: Tichelman will appear in court on February 23 where she will deny manslaughter charges . 'Initially, we were told that the video wasn't available from that particular camera - that actually showed the cabin of the boat. There was indeed video that was uploaded to a cloud server. And the video from that camera was indeed available,' Santa Cruz Deputy Police Chief Steve Clark tells 48 Hours in a new documentary about the case. 'That was one of those moments where you feel like, you know, it was 4th and 1. And you got a first down.' Actually, it took three months and a court order for detectives to get their hands on that video. When they did, it was explosive. 'That video was shocking to me,' said Clark, according to CBS. 'Well, the video's everything. The video is the case.' Describing the footage, which has not been seen by the public, Clark tells reporter Maureen Maher: 'They greet each other - a quick hug - just a quick embrace. You can see that they're engaged in conversation. But there's no audio,' Clark said. 'Then, eventually, she gets to the point where she starts to prepare drugs... for injection. 'We see her very clearly. She brought all of the equipment with her. She brought the drugs with her. 'We see her prepare the syringe. We see her - it looks like she's injecting herself, but her back's to the camera. 'He watches this happen. And then she eventually injects him.' Clark adds: 'I get the impression... he's nervous. He's uncertain. But he's going along with it. 'Almost immediately, he starts to go into distress. At some point, she comes to him. It looks like she tries to revive him a bit... by patting him on the face and talking to him, holding his head as he slumped forward on the chair. 'And you or I, if we found ourselves in that situation, would've been on the phone to 911, saying: \"Oh, my gosh. Something terrible's happened. We need help.\" And she does none of that.' In a move that will likely prove crucial to the case, Clark says, Tichelman is seen cleaning up the drugs, wiping fingerprints from the scene, then stepping over Hayes's lifeless body to leave. 'She is literally walking around the cabin of the boat... stepping over him, grabbing her glass of wine, carrying it around the boat cabin with her,' he says. Accusations: Police claim a video shows Tichelman watching Hayes die before stepping over him . On board: Tichelman's lawyers want police to release a surveillance video taken from the Santa Cruz yacht where Hayes was found which they claim proves it was an accidental, consensual overdose of heroin . For seven minutes, he tells Maher, Hayes is left alone. 'And that's seven minutes that emergency medical personnel could've been there could have done something and could have reacted to this situation to save Mr. Hayes' life. But instead, she does nothing, nothing to call for help or to fix this. You know, and that's the crux of the case,' Clark said. Clark's words come as Tichelman prepares for her trial, beginning in February. Tichelman has pleaded not guilty to charges of manslaughter, prostitution and transportation and sales of narcotics. She remains jailed in lieu of $1.5 million bond. 'We've always been curious in regard to Mr. Hayes' receptiveness, if not welcoming purchase, of drugs,' public defender Jerry Christensen told the judge on Friday. 'It would make a great deal of difference in regard to the drug crimes.' At her latest court appearance, in December, Tichelman rolled her eyes at camera crews and reporters as she entered the courtroom dressed in orange jail garb. Tichelman, 27, was arrested eight months later after police discovered the harbor's surveillance video. The squad lured her to her arrest by using a fake social media profile, posing as a potential client. 'My client Alix didn't do anything to Mr Hayes that he didn't want to happen to him,' defense attorney Larry Biggam said at a procedural hearing today, according to NBC. 'She did what she was asked. Consensual adults involved in mutual drug usage. It went wrong but it wasn't intended.' Biggam also called on police to release the full surveillance video taken from the boat, which prosecutors are using as evidence for a number of allegations. Her defense team has only seen 20 minutes of the footage described in court but Biggam insists it shows the overdose was 'accidental'. She now faces eight charges which all carry 15-year jail terms, including manslaughter, prostitution, destroying evidence and several related to administering and possessing heroin. Tichelman, who met her clients through a website called Seeking Arrangement, had exchanged texts and emails with Hayes and met with him a few times before the deadly November 26 encounter. Charges: Tichelman is facing up to 15 years for  eight charges including manslaughter and prostitution . Lured: She was arrested after law enforcement officers posed as a client and lured her to a Santa Cruz hotel . That day, they met on Hayes' 50-foot yacht, Escape, at the Santa Cruz Small Craft Harbor and Tichelman brought heroin before injecting him with the drug, police said. Authorities launched a nine-month investigation into the incident before eventually uncovering Tichelman's correspondence with the victim. They then tracked her down to her home in Folsom, where she lives with her parents, but lured her back to Santa Cruz County by posing as a client who said he wanted to pay her $1,000 for sex. She agreed to meet at a luxury hotel on Fourth of July and was arrested. Hayes, who was originally from Dearborn, Michigan was married for 17 years to wife Denise and together they had five children, according to his obituary. He worked in the auto industry before senior roles at Apple and Google. 'Forrest will be remembered above all as a loving husband and father. More than anything else he enjoyed spending time with his family at home and on his boat,' according to a January obituary. 'His brilliant mind, contagious smile and warm embrace will be missed and cherished in memories by his friends and family.' Tichelman's Facebook profile shows she went to high school in Atlanta before majoring in journalism at Georgia State University and attending beauty school. She lists her occupation as a makeup artist. She called herself a 'model' in jail records. On social media, she poses in lingerie and pouts with red lips for the camera. In an interview with fiXE fETISH magazine, she said she loved modeling because she got to play a character. 'I have always been attracted to the darker side,' she said. 'My parents said by the time I was three I was an 'intense child' and already liked horror movies.' She added that she loved fetishism and would often wear a leash when she went out with her boyfriend. She also posted pictures under another Facebook profile, AK Kennedy, and talks about heroin and her love of the serial killer TV show, 'Dexter'. Seeking Arrangement, the website through which Tichelman and Hayes met, is described as being a site for connecting 'sugar babies' with 'sugar daddies and mommas' - but the company maintains it is not promoting prostitution."}

When a fan fell ill after trying to make Delia Smith’s recipe for chilli con carne, he set off a celebrity feud that is continuing to simmer more than 30 years later. Miss Smith has become embroiled in a war of words with former That’s Life! presenter Esther Rantzen over accusations that the cookery writer failed to warn readers to pre-boil kidney beans to make them safe to eat. Miss Rantzen reheated the row this week by claiming she was ‘leaned’ on by her BBC bosses to apologise for broadcasting the claim in the consumer programme in the 1970s. Feud: Delia Smith (left) became embroiled in a war of words with Esther Rantzen (right) after a row over a chilli con carne recipe . A viewer had written in to say he fell ‘terribly ill’ after trying out the chilli recipe in Delia Smith’s Cookery Course, a best-seller published by the BBC. It was discovered that he had failed to cook the red kidney beans in Miss Smith’s recipe thoroughly enough. The beans need to be boiled for at least ten minutes to destroy high concentrations of lectin, a harmful toxin. Recalling the incident this week, Miss Rantzen, now 73, said Miss Smith threatened to withdraw publication rights for the book from the BBC unless she received an apology. ‘At the time Delia was the biggest money-earner for the BBC,’ she said. ‘She was the Jeremy Clarkson of her day. ‘Her cookbooks were a huge money-earner for the BBC and she was about to launch another book, and I am told, and I don’t know if this is true, that she said to the BBC, “Unless That’s Life apologise I am going to take my book to another publisher”. ‘The bosses said I had to apologise. It was the most obscure apology you have ever heard. I am not sure we did not put it to music. ‘What we said was [the viewer] made the mistake … and we told viewers they would have to make sure [the beans] were cooked, and Delia changed her recipe. I think honour was preserved on both sides.’ Despite the passing of the years, Miss Smith, 72, remains furious over the suggestion that her recipe made the viewer ill. She also denied the suggestion that she had threatened to withdraw publication rights from the BBC. She told the Daily Mail last night that Miss Rantzen’s remarks in the 1970s were ‘very damaging’ because her original cooking instructions were ‘perfectly safe’. A spicy dish with a dash of controversy: Delia's chilli recipe . Tasty dish: The recipe for chilli con carne was 'perfectly safe' according to Miss Smith . ‘The recipe stated that the mixture should be brought up to simmering point in a flameproof casserole over direct heat, then transferred to a pre-heated oven,’ she said. ‘This meant the kidney beans did not come off the boil for two hours. ‘The one person who had complained to That’s Life! had not actually followed my recipe. The chilli had been made in a porcelain dish (ie not flameproof) and therefore placed in the oven cold.’ Miss Smith said there was ‘never any question’ of her withdrawing publication rights. ‘I have always assumed that it was the production team that finally realised they had acted irresponsibly and committed a libel, whatever Miss Rantzen thinks she now remembers,’ she said. Delia Smith’s Cookery Course, which has been reprinted many times, now contains a clear warning on the importance of cooking kidney beans thoroughly."}

The agency has only three business days to complete the checks. Failing to do so means the person trying to buy the gun is allowed to purchase the weapon without being checked out at the discretion of the vendor. Most major retailers will not allow a purchase to go through without a completed check.

{"prompt": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Ready for your Super Bowl party? Sure, you have drinks, hot wings, maybe even a favorite jersey. But do you have an M-16, a Kevlar helmet and body armor? Pittsburgh Steelers fan Sheresa Coleman will watch the Super Bowl from the USS Mahan in the Gulf of Aden. Not everybody is watching the game from the comfort of the family den. Hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops will be deployed in remote war zones, on lonely oceans and at overseas bases -- all far away from an NBC affiliate. So the military is going out of its way to make sure that many soldiers, Marines, airmen and sailors can watch Super Bowl XLIII live. \"Super Bowl day has really become a holiday, military-wise, over the last couple years,\" said Petty Officer 1st Class Grant Shannon. Shannon is from a town about an hour north of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, but is on board the USS Mahan, a destroyer deployed to stop pirates working off the coast of Somalia. When they finish their duties, sailors like Shannon can head to the ship's mess to watch the Pittsburgh Steelers take on the Arizona Cardinals. The same is true for soldiers, Marines and airmen in combat zones. \"We can broadcast to every forward operating base in Iraq and Afghanistan,\" said Andreas Friedrich, the deputy director of Armed Forces Radio and Television Services, which has been sending the Super Bowl to troops overseas since the first Super Bowl, broadcasting it live since 1981.  Watch how troops will be able to watch big game » . All told, about 1 million American military personnel and civilians overseas will be able to watch the big game. Some of those watching will be benefiting from the same technology that makes Predator Unmanned Aerial Vehicle missions possible. A global broadcast system will beam the game to ships and submarines far out in the Pacific Ocean. GBS is how pilots in the United States can watch and fly an unmanned vehicle over a battlefield halfway around the world, and then feed what they see to the battlefield commanders on the ground below. Raytheon, the company that runs the system, will use one of its video channels to feed the game to several U.S. Navy submarines and ships in the Pacific. Tens of thousands of sailors will be able to see the game via GBS, which first broadcast a Super Bowl in 2003, according to Guy DuBois of Raytheon. \"It's a pretty amazing feeling, when you get to do that, to watch it on the ship and knowing that everybody else is back home having a good time, just like we will be,\" said Petty Officer 3rd Class Ryan Wright, a Cardinals fan from Arizona. Wright is on board the USS San Antonio, an amphibious transport dock that is part of the anti-piracy task force. A Steelers fan on board the USS Mahan agrees. \"It would be nice to be home and watch the game in my hometown,\" said Seaman Sheresa Coleman of Pittsburgh. \"But it's a great honor to support and defend the Constitution of the United States.\" One thing Wright and the other overseas Super Bowl viewers will miss is the legendary Super Bowl commercials. Friedrich said the Armed Forces Radio and Television Services would have had to pay high fees for the rights to broadcast the Super Bowl commercials to an international audience. Instead, the multimillion-dollar ads that some people consider the best part of the game will be pre-empted in favor of Department of Defense-produced ads and public service messages. Still, even without seeing football-playing Clydesdales or movie-shilling monsters, those in uniform appreciate being part of America's unofficial midwinter holiday. \"We have lots of sailors and Marines on board who have followed the season,\" said Cmdr. Eric Cash, the commander of the USS San Antonio. \"Any time we can enjoy some traditional American sports like the Super Bowl, it's always a great time for us, a good mental break and also a good time for people to get together and socialize.\" Just like home. But you have to wonder -- does the ship's galley have nachos or pigs in a blanket?"}

{"prompt": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida (CNN) -- She walked to the cameras and could barely look up. With her lip quivering, Sherry Jarvis apologized to the family of 15-year-old Michael Brewer, who is clinging to life in a hospital burn unit. Jarvis is the mother of two boys who, along with three other youths, are accused in the burning of Brewer. Detectives say witnesses saw Brewer, consumed in flames, run about a hundred yards, tear off his shirt and jump into a swimming pool. Brewer's screams can be heard on a 911 call from the October 12 incident. Doctors say he was burned on about 65 percent of his body. \"I'd just like to express how horribly sorry we are,\" Jarvis said in a public statement she and her family made Wednesday. Accompanied by her husband and two daughters, Jarvis spoke slowly as she addressed a gathering of reporters. \"This is a horrible incident that should have never had occurred.\" said Jarvis, her voice full of sorrow and shock. Her sons, ages 13 and 15, face charges that could send them to prison for a long time. Authorities in Broward County, Florida, believe that Brewer was attacked in a chain of events that began when he did not pay one of the five boys $40 for a video game. That boy stole Brewer's father's bicycle, and when Brewer told police, the youth was arrested, then released, authorities said. The next day, the group of five teens allegedly surrounded Brewer and, according to eyewitnesses, yelled, \"He's a snitch. He's a snitch\" before one of them poured alcohol over him, another sparked a lighter, and Brewer was ablaze. All of the boys had been friends since elementary school, authorities said. They did sleepovers at one another's homes, and their families knew each other. \"We pray for Michael's recovery every day, that he gets stronger, which we know in our hearts that he will,\" Sherry Jarvis said. But doctors are unsure about his recovery. Brewer remains on a ventilator. A machine is breathing for him. Each day, a team of doctors spends about four hours changing his bandages. He remains heavily sedated and is going through a very difficult period right now, according to doctors. \"The swelling has come way down, and you can recognize facial expressions now,\" said Dr. Nicholas Namias, medical director of the University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Hospital Burn Center in Miami. \"We're still dealing with the respiratory failure. We're dealing with infection now and the need to supply the massive amount of nutrition that this person needs to survive,\" Namias told CNN. \"People are writing horror stories ... but people just can't imagine the kind of sickness we're talking about. He is by no means well ... but the expectation is survival,\" he said. Because he is sedated and on the ventilator, Brewer has been unable to communicate with detectives. Earlier this week, prosecutors were granted extra time to build their cases against the five teens, four 15-year-olds and the 13-year-old. Prosecutors have until November 12 to charge the five as adults, or they will be charged as juveniles and released pending trial later. The 13-year-old cannot face adult charges under Florida law, but that would change if Brewer died. Prosecutors want to interview Brewer about the incident, but doctors say that is unlikely to happen before next week. Brewer's family was not represented at the Jarvis family's public apology. The victim's parents could not be reached for comment. After making her apology, Jarvis said the family would not take questions from the gathered reporters. \"I don't have the words to express any more. I can't answer any more questions because of the criminal case that's still pending,\" she said. The Jarvis family has received death threats, according to family members and their attorney. They haven't stayed at their home since the incident, they say, adding that people have been throwing garbage and even dead animals on their property. On Wednesday, with their attorney at their side, they simply wanted to say to Michael Brewer and his family that they are sorry. Detectives have returned to the Brewer house, after two dolls were found in the swimming pool. The male and female dolls had been melted together, head to feet. \"At this point, we're thinking it's a sick joke, said Jim Leljedal, a spokesman for the Broward County Sheriff's Office. \"It's being classified as criminal mischief, but we'd like to know who's responsible,\" he said."}

Celtic captain Scott Brown declared his furious team-mates ready to ram taunts from Legia Warsaw players down their throats to secure a Champions League lifeline. The Parkhead skipper missed last week’s first-leg defeat in the Polish capital through long-term injury but was left incensed by the antics of the Poles as they goaded their Scottish opponents at the end of the shock 4-1 win. For Brown, the incident reminded him of the antics of Shakhter Karagandy after Celtic’s 2-0 Champions League qualifying defeat in Kazakhstan last season. Spurred on by such ‘disrespect’ in the first leg, Celtic duly won the return in Glasgow 3-0 to progress on aggregate, with Brown booked for celebrating in the face of Kazakh keeper Aleksandr Mokin at full-time.

Now the 29-year-old Scotland skipper expects his side to ease the pressure on under-fire boss Ronny Deila by ensuring the Poles face a similar backlash at Murrayfield tomorrow night. ‘The Legia players got a bit  over-confident and celebrated in our boys’ faces — our lads will remember every single thing,’ vowed Brown. ‘The lads will be thinking about that as soon as they go into the game. They will want to be the ones doing the celebrating at  full-time. ‘Last year, it was similar against Karagandy, and it was such a great night when we went through. It was one of those nights people think only happen in fairytales. ‘But we turned it around that night after getting battered over there — and it’s pretty much the same squad of players we have just now. ‘Yes, we have a lot to do in the second leg and it will be hard, but they are not the best team in the world — and everyone is due a bad result.

McAvennie, part of the Hoops’ double-winning centenary side in 1988, also criticised the board for playing tomorrow night’s crucial qualifier at the home of Scottish rugby, claiming that their chances of overturning the 4-1 first leg deficit would have been greater at Celtic Park. ‘I hope he is not the puppet some people say he is but I fear he might be,’ said McAvennie. ‘What manager comes into a club and is told who his right-hand man will be?

{"prompt": "Many DIY sunscreens contain oils that actually speed up burning . By . Lauren Lumsden . Dermatologists are issuing harsh warnings against making your own sunblock, as hundreds of DIY formulas make their way around the internet. Many bloggers who post the recipes claim that store-bought sunscreens contain harsh chemicals that could be as bad - if not worse - for you than the sun. But doctors say there's no way to guarantee homemade concoctions offer broadband protection (that is, shield against wrinkle-inducing UVA rays as well as cancer-causing UVB-rays), or ensure that the SPF is high enough. Ouch! Doctors say that if you make your own sunscreen there's no way to guarantee yourself protection from harsh UVA and UVB rays . New York-based dermatologist Whitney Bowe told MailOnline that making and using your own sunscreen is 'effectively putting your skin at risk for melanoma.' 'Sunscreen companies invest millions of dollars formulating and testing sunscreens to ensure they are stable and effective,' she says. 'Sunscreen companies invest millions of dollars formulating and testing sunscreens to ensure they are stable and effective' 'Tests are conducted in the lab and on humans to ensure they provide broad-spectrum protection and that the ingredients remain stable and active when mixed together and exposed to heat and sun.' A quick Google or Pinterest search shows that many of the recipes call for various oils - like coconut, almond, rosehip and carrot seed oils - which can actually promote sunburns. Joshua Zeichner, another dermatologist in New York, explained to Allure that oils 'can actually absorb light, making UV rays penetrate the skin more.' 'That has the same effect as greasing up with baby lotion when you go to the beach,' he said. But even if you do use the right ingredients, like zinc oxide, cosmetic chemists say there is an art to mixing them together, and if you do it wrong - which chances are you will - the sunscreen will be ineffective. So, despite all these warnings against it, why are bloggers still trying to make their own? They say that many of the store-bought brands contain harsh chemicals that can actually alter your hormones. Their argument might not be completely without merit. Arthur Perry, a New York-based plastic surgeon and Adjunct Associate Professor of Surgery at Columbia University, explained on Doctor Oz's website that chemical sunscreens soak into the skin and get into your bloodstream. Of the 15 chemical sunscreens that exist, nine are considered 'endocrine disruptors,' meaning they interfere with the normal function of hormones. Mr Perry said that the hormones most commonly disturbed include estrogen, progesterone, testosterone and thyroid. This can lead to early puberty and premature breast development in girls, small and undescended testicles in boys, low sperm counts, infertility, breast and ovarian cancers in women, and prostate cancer in men. According to the Environmental Working Group, the ingredients that are most disruptive are: oxybenzone, octinoxate, homosalate, octisalate, and octocrylene. A quick survey of the most commonly found sunscreens in a Duane Reade showed that almost all of them contained one or more of the above. That said, is there a healthy compromise? Are there any store-bought sunscreens without harsh chemicals? New York-based dermatologist Sherry Shieh says yes: 'The chemical-free sunscreens these days are excellent. They're fragrance-free and non-toxic.' 'There is no reason from a safety, cost, or time standpoint to make your own.' Bloggers and doctors generally agree that mineral sunscreens are best; that is, creams where the chief protection is provided by zinc oxide or titanium oxide. Brands that use these minerals include Honest, Sun Stuff, Alba Botanica, Badger, and Climb On. If you do go the natural route, keep in mind that the SPF is usually lower - so you will need to apply more often, as well as every time you get wet."}

A few hours earlier, two officers were sent to investigate a report of a large group gathered outside the singer's home, said David Grimes, watch commander for the west division of the Los Angeles Police Department. The two officers found 20 to 25 people near the house around 11 p.m. Wednesday and they asked them to leave, he said. ABC-TV host Barbara Walters reported on Monday's \"The View\" that she had been contacted by Spears' manager and \"good friend,\" Lufti, who told her the pop star has seen a psychiatrist and \"is suffering from what he describes as mental issues which are treatable,\" according to The Associated Press.

Police had been called to her home that night to mediate a custody dispute.  A day later, a California court refused to grant Spears visitation rights with her two children -- Sean Preston, 2, and Jayden James, 1 -- at least until mid-February. Spears has been in a heated dispute with ex-husband Kevin Federline over custody of their sons. Federline, Spears' former backup dancer, holds primary custody of the children. Spears has been in trouble with the court earlier concerning her compliance with court orders in the custody case. After filing for divorce in November 2006, Spears was frequently seen enjoying Hollywood nightlife. Her behavior became increasingly erratic; in February 2007, she shaved her head as paparazzi looked on, then spent a month in rehab. E-mail to a friend .

Winning is something Woods has not yet done this year, in a truncated season marked by back surgery in March and again in August after his attempted return was aborted after missing the cut at the PGA Championship. The 38-year-old proclaimed himself healthy and on the way back after working with a new swing consultant, if perhaps a bit rusty. But some of his big rivals this week admitted that Woods looked to be striking the ball in the manner he was once famous for.

'Obviously, been playing at home with my boys for a little bit of cash, but still (that is) a little bit different. Every shot counts a little bit more. (But) Felt good.' It also felt comfortable for Woods, who is staging the event this year at Isleworth, the enclave he had called home for over a decade before moving to Jupiter Island.

In a fascinating battle Sunday, Team Sky's Froome caught and then passed Nairo Quintana during the steep 13-mile climb to give him a four-minute cushion over his nearest rivals. A spent Froome had to be given oxygen when the 15th stage -- the longest of this year's Tour at 150 miles -- ended but he'll get a chance to recover during Monday's day off. On Bastille Day French hopes were dashed, as Sylvain Chavanel lost his lead to Movistar's Quintana before the Colombian faded and Froome charged. \"I thought he'd be less strong than he was,\" Quintana told the Tour's website. Froome has now won both stages with summit finishes. \"I didn't expect to win,\" Britain's Froome said after nearly six hours of racing. \"I wanted to get more of a buffer on the general classification but I didn't think I could go for the win. \"Quintana is a very strong climber and I wasn't expecting him to go from as far as he did but hats off to him. He did a great ride and he showed how strong he is.\" Despite the gruelling end to the stage, Froome and Quintana -- one to watch for the future -- had time for a quick chat. \"In the last (1.2 miles) he was fading a little and I still had a little bit left,\" said Froome. \"I was just trying to say, 'Man, come on just a little bit more, we're almost there.' But he was slipping behind. \"Near the end I don't think that I attacked. It was just that he couldn't ride on my wheel anymore and a gap opened up.\" On Friday, Froome saw his lead cut to under three minutes by Belkin's Bauke Mollema and Saxo-Tinkoff's Alberto Contador. After Sunday, though, he leads Mollema by four minutes, 14 seconds and two-time winner Contador by 4:25."}

{"prompt": "Warning: Justice Hedley said the couples' conflict had affected the children . A High Court judge issued a stark warning yesterday about the traumatic effects on children when complicated homosexual parenting arrangements unravel. In a case in which a gay man and his lover took the lesbian mother of his children and her partner to court for access rights, the judge expressed frustration at the ‘lack of sufficient vocabulary to explain the true nature of the relationships’. But Mr Justice Hedley was clear about the impact of the couples’ conflict on the two sisters in the case, saying at least one of them had suffered significant emotional harm. ‘The four adults in this case regard the price paid by these two children as an acceptable price for the pursuit of their own adult disputes,’ he said. The identity of the girls, aged six and ten, and their four parents was kept secret in the Family Division judgment published yesterday. The judge said the adults involved were ‘intelligent professional people’ who agreed to have children through IVF ‘with the agreement and co-operation of all parties’. But he warned: ‘The case provides a vivid illustration of just how wrong these arrangements can go.’ The adults involved are the mother of the two children and her lesbian civil partner, now aged 45 and 44, and the biological father of the girls and his long-standing gay partner, aged 50 and 41. The couples met after the women placed an advert in The Pink Paper in July 1999 looking for ‘a gay man or couple who would like to start a family with a lesbian couple’. The men replied, saying ‘we would love to be father and stepfather’. Gay parenting: The case provides a very real warning to couples entering into artificial insemination arrangements . Ruling: The tug-of-love case was heard at the High Court (pictured) After the birth of the first child, the couples maintained friendly relations for several years, but ‘it all went wrong’ in 2008 when they fell into dispute over the children. The judgment quotes a social worker who said the older daughter was caught in ‘a horrendous tangle of emotion and conflict that exists between these adults. The girl is being made to carry the responsibility for the failure of the adults in this system to overcome the conflicts between them.’ Mr Justice Hedley said there was ‘widespread concern at the welfare of the children’. 'Case provides a real warning' He ruled that the two women should be regarded as ‘primary parents’ with the main responsibility for bringing up the girls, but the men should be regarded as ‘secondary parents’. The gay couple should be consulted on issues of health, medical operations, education and moves of house. The judge also made a contact order so they could see the girls at set times. Mr Justice Hedley said: ‘It is all too easy in these cases for biological fathers to see themselves in the same position as in separated parent cases in heterosexual arrangements, whereas this arrangement is, and was always intended to be, quite different. ‘I have tried hard to see whether there are any other concepts than that of mother, father and primary carer, all conventional family concepts. ‘The best that I have achieved . . . is to contemplate the concept of principal and secondary parenting.’ He said gay and lesbian couples should decide in advance who will bring up the children if they choose to have babies. Linzi Bull of the law firm Harbottle & Lewis, which represented the men, said: ‘The case provides a very real warning to couples entering into artificial insemination arrangements.’"}

For generations it has been the family friendly board game used to while away a rainy afternoon. But it seems the latest generation of Monopoly players are simply too busy for the full version of the game. Instead its makers, Hasbro, have launched a new kids version of the classic which can be completed in less than half an hour so it can fit into its young players’ busy schedules. Monopoly Empire is on the list of top toy predictions for youngsters with an action packed schedule and short attention span . Manufacturers say the new Monopoly Empire game, which is aimed at children of eight and older, is meeting demand in the market from youngsters who simply don’t have the attention span to play for hours. Either that or they cant fit it in among their frantic schedules of ballet classes and football practice. In America, makers of the US version . of the game have become so concerned by busy pre-teens that they . have even eliminated the jail, so children don’t waste time waiting to . roll a double. And Hasbro aren’t the only ones making their games quicker to play. As . a whole the toy industry have made a move to offer what they call . ‘snack toys’ to appeal to children who have very little play time . because of their action packed days. Toy . manufacturers have been updating other games such as Scrabble and . Boggle with new speedier versions to keep the attention of their . increasingly distracted young customers. How it used to be: Mother and son spending quality time together playing Monopoly - back then children were encouraged to build a property empire on the classic board or even 'go to jail' Thanks to its new incarnation as Scrabble Flash, it is now possible to complete a round of the classic word game in just two and a half minutes. Siobhan Freegard, of Netmums, pictured at her home in Harrow. She says: 'The frantic pace of modern life makes it very hard to get the whole family together to play a board game' Netmums founder Siobhan Freegard said the development of these shorter games showed how traditional board games had become a casualty of modern society but added that even playing a short game was better than watching endless hours of TV. She said: ‘The frantic pace of modern life makes it very hard to get the whole family together to play a board game. ‘With many families having both dad and mum out at work all day, evenings are more likely to be spent doing homework or household chores than leisurely playing board games. ‘So at first glance this seems a sad indictment of the breakneck speed we live our lives. However, as society isn’t going to change anytime soon, perhaps it is simple Monopoly being pragmatic. ‘If a short version encourages young kids to get into the game instead of watching TV or playing on the computer, then it would be welcomed by many parents.’ And it appears it is not just the children that have increasingly hectic schedules to keep up with. Last year a joined survey with Netmums and toy manufacturers Mattel questioned more than 1,200 parents and found that more than a quarter are now so busy they only play board games with their families twice a year. But it’s not just the length of play that has changed with the new edition of Monopoly, in a surrender to 21st century commercialism children are now encouraged to buy and sell brands rather than properties as they move around the board. Hasbro, the world’s largest board game maker, has sought the involvement of leading global brands such as Mc Donalds, X-Box and Coca Cola which occupy the spaces on the board ones marked out by the streets of London. Instead of building houses and hotels children collect tiles relating to each brand and use them to build up their own skyscraper in the centre of the board. The winner is the first to complete their skyscraper. Computer games, toys, ballet and sport are keeping children too busy to sit down with their families - the classic Monopoly board game is being updated to compete for the attention of pre-teens . But Mrs Freegard maintains that if these shorter games give children a taste for the joy of a good board game, it still may mean a resurrection of the full version as they get older. She added: ‘Lots of eight year olds also don’t have the concentration for the full version and mastering the short game will undoubtedly improve their skills and teach them patience. ‘And if they enjoy the short version, it will encourage them to try the longer version, preserving an interest in board games for the next generation.’"}

Navas was devastated to be left out of the Spain squad along with Alvaro Negredo, and could only watch as many of his City teammates endured a disappointing tournament in Brazil. David Silva was unable to prevent the holders going out at the group stage, Joe Hart and James Milner also made an early exit with England, Yaya Toure disappointed for Ivory Coast, and Fernandinho was caught up in Brazil's disastrous collapse. Ready to roll: Spanish winger Jesus Navas in the new Manchester City away kit . Even though Sergio Aguero, Pablo Zabaleta and Martin Demichelis reached the final with Argentina, it ended in tears with a heartbreaking extra-time defeat to Germany. 'Certainly I think there will be more hunger for us to win things this season now,' said Navas, who modelled City's new away kit which was unveiled in New York on Friday. 'We've got enough talent in the team to win the Premier League again and hopefully the Champions League as well. The quality is there and that will show. Focused: Jesus Navas is eager to make an impression after missing out on the World Cup . 'Winning the title in my first season at City was a dream come true but the downside was not being selected for Spain's World Cup squad. I was extremely disappointed and for me it's very important to have this season to keep playing and be selected for Spain going forward.' Navas revealed that the Premier League champions have placed particular importance on Europe this season. Manuel Pellegrini led City past the group stage for the first time in his first year at the club but they were beaten by Barcelona at the first knockout stage. Heartache: Sergio Aguero's Argentina were beaten in the World Cup final by Germany . 'Obviously we need to aim higher and the Champions League is the next step,' said the Spain winger. 'It would be great to win the title again but obviously the Champions League is the target this year. We went past the group stage of the Champions League last season so the aim is to go as far as we possibly can.' A number of City’s World Cup contingent, including Toure, Hart, Milner and Edin Dzeko, returned to training at the team’s New Jersey base on Friday. City will fly to Pittsburgh on Saturday ahead of their second tour game against AC Milan, although those players are unlikely to feature before the fourth fixture against Olympiacos next weekend."}

Over the years her reputation has grown and in 2003, to celebrate her 50 years as publican, brewers Coors created OWB – Olive Wilson’s Brew. Legend: Britain's longest serving landlady Olive Wilson has spent 60 years behind the bar, and still has no plans to stop pulling pints anytime soon . When she began her career she had no experience behind the bar and said it was unusual for women to work, let alone be landlady. The grandmother-of-four was reluctant and thought she would only spend a few years at the pub with her husband Lewis before they moved on. 'The customers were all men and I did my ironing behind the bar if it was quiet,' said Mrs Wilson told The Mirror.

The mother of a sick teenage girl caught in a year-long, custody battle with doctors collapsed on Monday after a judge decided the 15-year-old should be placed in foster care and not returned to her family. The decision to prolong Justina Pelletier's separation from her family caused her mother Linda to faint at the Boston courthouse. The 56-year-old, who is diabetic, was stretchered out and taken to Massachusetts General Hospital. Speaking from her Connecticut home today, Linda Pelletier told MailOnline that doctors said her blackout was caused by the high stress she has been suffering over her daughter's ordeal, which the mother described as 'evil'. Mrs Pelletier said: 'I ask my husband every day, ''Are they trying to kill her?''' Scroll down for video . Linda Pelletier was taken to Massachusetts General Hospital on Monday , accompanied by her daughter Jennifer, after she collapsed on finding out that her sick daughter Justina will remain in foster care . Desperate: Justina Pelletier, 15, pictured with her mom Linda, has now spent a year in a psychiatric ward after she was taken from her parents against their will on doctor's orders . Mrs Pelletier and husband Lou have been battling Boston Children's Hospital and the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families to regain custody of their once vibrant daughter Justina since February 2013. Justina . Pelletier was diagnosed with . Mitochondrial Disease, a rare genetic muscle-wasting illness, by Tufts . Medical Center in 2011 and was undergoing a drug treatment program. However last year, while being treated for flu at Boston's Children’s . Hospital, experts said she had Somatoform Disorder, a stress-related mental . illness where people 'imagine they are ill'. When the teen's parents contested the hospital's diagnosis and sought to have their daughter treated by her own doctor, officials reportedly refused and a short time later, the girl was taken into the custody of the state. The teenager was transferred to a residential psychiatric unit at the end of January 2013 and has remained there since. Mrs Pelletier, who has three other daughters and cares for her 93-year-old mother at West Hartford home, told MailOnline on Tuesday: 'I have had no medical updates about my child. She is deteriorating - she can't stand, sit, she has chronic pain. 'When I saw her on Friday, her stomach was distended, she didn't feel well. But nobody helps her.' Massachusetts Department of Children and Families said in a statement: 'The Department of Children and Families does not comment or provide any information regarding children in our custody. Additionally, the Court has maintained a gag order in this case, prohibiting any parties from discussing the case or details surrounding it.' Wayside Youth residential unit in Framingham where Miss Pelletier is currently being held was unable to comment on specific cases. Anguish: Justina Pelletier's mother Linda and sister Jennifer are rushed to a waiting ambulance after the 56-year-old collapsed following the judge's ruling that her daughter will be kept in foster care . Happy: The family maintain that Justina was healthy and contented before she was admitted to hospital a year ago. They said she was a keen ice-skater and loved hiking with her dog Roxie (right) The family is devastated that Justina is now scheduled to . be moved from a residential center in Framingham to Shore Educational . Collaborative which is even further from the family's home in West . Hartford, Connecticut and makes it more difficult to visit. Although . the judge's ruling is only temporary until the next court date on March 17, . it is another heartbreaking decision in an anguished year for the . Pelletier family. A gag order also remains in place over the custody proceedings until that time. Mrs Pelletier said on Tuesday that she has no faith in the justice system since her daughter was taken from her family, calling the court hearings a 'joke'. However the mother-of-four said her family was now being helped by several lawyers and organizations. She said: 'I'm so grateful, they have given me hope. I feel like God has finally listened.' Fears: Lou and Linda say Justina 'is barely recognizable as her health has deteriorated so badly' We miss you: Sitting on Justina's bed at her Connecticut home are her sisters: From left, Julia, Jennifer and Jessica. Jessica, far right, has been diagnosed as having the same Mitochondrial Disease that Justina was being treated for before she was 'kidnapped' after a visit to Boston Children's Hospital with a bout of the flu . Mr Pelletier told MailOnline last month that his daughter's health had declined drastically. He said: 'Her legs are paralyzed, she has no upper body strength and she is in constant pain because they have removed most of her medications. Justina Pelletier was diagnosed with . mitochondrial disease in 2011, a genetic condition that . affects muscle coordination and mobility. There is no cure for the condition that is progressive and can be fatal. Symptoms can include weakness, intolerance for exercise, heart failure, dementia and rhythm disturbances. Each year, 1,000-4,000 children in the U.S. are born with the disease. However last year doctors concluded Miss Pellietier was suffering from Somafotorm disorder, a . psychological condition that causes sufferers to feel pain, although . there is no physical cause for it. Sufferers do not feign the physical symptoms they feel, rather they present themselves as the result of mental strain. Doctors cannot identify the sources of patients' pain and instead prescribe anti-depressants. Experts . estimate that between 0.2 and 2 per cent of females and less than 0.2. per cent of men in the US suffer from the condition. 'She suffered a stroke when she was seven and it affected her short-term memory. She is considered learning disabled, yet she has had no education in the last year. 'Justina did manage to sneak a few notes out of the hospital but she can’t do that anymore. She has forgotten how to write and spell. 'From what we can gather, she spends 24 hours a day lying in a room. It is a locked psychiatric unit full of children with major psychiatric problems. 'Justina doesn’t have psychiatric problems, she is ill and she needs proper medical care. Once a week she is taken on a three-hour round trip to see doctors but that is it. 'We are only allowed to see her for one hour a week at a Department of Children and Families office. Health aside, she is a mess.

{"prompt": "Fearing a Russian invasion and occupation of Alaska, the U.S. government in the early Cold War years recruited and trained fishermen, bush pilots, trappers and other private citizens across Alaska for a covert network to feed wartime intelligence to the military, newly declassified Air Force and FBI documents show. Invasion of Alaska? Yes. It seemed like a real possibility in 1950. 'The military believes that it would be an airborne invasion involving bombing and the dropping of paratroopers,' one FBI memo said. The most likely targets were thought to be Nome, Fairbanks, Anchorage and Seward. Declassified: Fearing a Russian invasion and occupation of Alaska, the U.S. government in the early Cold War years recruited and trained fishermen, bush pilots, trappers and other private citizens across Alaska for a covert network to feed wartime intelligence to the military, newly declassified Air Force and FBI documents show . Feared the Russians: Hoover teamed up on the highly classified project, code-named Washtub, with the newly created Air Force Office of Special Investigations, headed by Hoover protege and former FBI official Joseph F. Carroll . So FBI director J. Edgar Hoover teamed up on a highly classified project, code-named 'Washtub,' with the newly created Air Force Office of Special Investigations, headed by Hoover protege and former FBI official Joseph F. Carroll. The secret plan was to have citizen-agents in key locations in Alaska ready to hide from the invaders of what was then only a U.S. territory. The citizen-agents would find their way to survival caches of food, cold-weather gear, message-coding material and radios. In hiding they would transmit word of enemy movements. Main players: This 1961 photo released by the Defense Intelligence Agency shows Air Force Lieut. Gen. Joseph Carroll upon his nomination to first director of the Defense Intelligence Agency . This was not civil defense of the sort that became common later in the Cold War as Americans built their own bomb shelters. This was an extraordinary enlistment of civilians as intelligence operatives on U.S. soil. This account of the 'Washtub' project is based on hundreds of pages of formerly secret documents. The heavily censored records were provided to The Associated Press by the Government Attic, a website that publishes government documents it obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. The Russians never invaded, of course. So the covert cadre of 'stay-behind agents,' as they were known, was never activated to collect and report wartime information from backwoods bunkers. It was an assignment that federal officials acknowledged (to each other, if not to the new agents) was highly dangerous, given that the Soviet Union's military doctrine called for the elimination of local resistance in occupied territory. To compensate for expected casualties, a reserve pool of agents was to be held outside of Alaska and inserted by air later as short-term replacements. This assignment was seen as an easier sell to potential recruits because 'some agents might not be too enthusiastic about being left behind in enemy-occupied areas for an indefinite period of time,' one planning document noted dryly. 'Washtub' was not, however, a washout. It operated from 1951-59, according to Deborah Kidwell, official historian of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, or OSI. 'While war with the Soviet Union did not come to Alaska, OSI trained 89 SBA (stay-behind agents), and the survival caches served peacetime purposes for many years to come,' she wrote in an OSI magazine last year. With the benefit of hindsight, it would be easy to dismiss 'Washtub' as a harebrained scheme born of paranoia. In fact it reflected genuine worry about Soviet intentions and a sense of U.S. vulnerability in a turbulent post-World War II period. As the plan was being shaped in 1950, Soviet-backed North Korea invaded South Korea, triggering a war on the peninsula that some in the Pentagon saw as a deliberate move by Moscow to distract Washington before invading Europe. The previous summer the Soviets stunned the world by exploding their first atomic bomb. Also in 1949, the U.S. locked arms with Western Europe to form the NATO alliance, and Mao Zedong's revolutionaries declared victory in China, adding to American fear that communism was on the march. Washtub: This undated handout image obtained by The Associated Press shows an Air Force chart showing the organization, by function and lines of authority, of the Washtub project . Close: A map shows the jarring proximity of Russia to Alaska, the closest point of which is just 2.3 miles from country to country via the islands of Little and Big Diomede . 'Washtub' was known inside the government by several other codenames, including Corpuscle, Stigmatic and Catboat, according to an official Air Force history of the OSI, which called it one of OSI's 'most extensive and long-running Cold War projects.' The FBI had its own code word for the project: STAGE. 'Washtub' had two phases. The first and more urgent was the stay-behind agent program. The second was a parallel effort to create a standby pool of civilian operatives in Alaska trained to clandestinely arrange for the evacuation of downed military air crews in danger of being captured by Soviet forces. This 'evasion and escape' plan was coordinated with the CIA. Among those listed as a stay-behind agent was Dyton Abb Gilliland of Cooper Landing, a community on the Kenai Peninsula south of Anchorage. A well-known bush pilot, Gilliland died in a plane crash on Montague Island in Prince William Sound in May 1955 at age 45. FBI records say he spent 12 days in Washington D.C., in June-July 1951 undergoing a range of specialized training, including in the use of parachutes. The agents also got extensive training in coding and decoding messages, but this apparently did not always go well. Learning these techniques was 'an almost impossible task for backwoodsmen to master in 15 hours of training,' one document said. Details in the document were blacked out. Many agent names in the OSI and FBI documents also were removed before being declassified. None of the indigenous population was included. The program founders believed that agents from the 'Eskimo, Indian and Aleut groups in the Territory should be avoided in view of their propensities to drink to excess and their fundamental indifference to constituted governments and political philosophies. It is pointed out that their prime concern is with survival and their allegiance would easily shift to any power in control.' Codenames: Washtub was known inside the government by several other codenames, including Corpuscle, Stigmatic and Catboat, according to an official Air Force history of the OSI, which called it one of OSI's 'most extensive and long-running Cold War projects.' The FBI had its own code word for the project: STAGE . Recruiters pitched patriotism and were to offer retainer fees of up to $3,000 a year (nearly $30,000 in 2014 dollars). That sum was to be doubled 'after an invasion has commenced,' according to one planning document. The records do not say how much was actually paid during the course of the program. At least some recruits were fingerprinted and all were secretly screened by the FBI for signs of disloyalty. The FBI linked one candidate, a resident of Stony River, to a list of names in a 1943 bureau file on 'Communist Party activities, Alaska' that tracked U.S. subscribers to a magazine called 'Soviet Russia Today.' Another candidate was flagged - falsely, it turned out - as a likely communist sympathizer based on an FBI informant's tip about membership in the 'Tom Paine Club, Communist Party, Spokane, Washington.' A September 6, 1951 memo in which FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover says it's time to pull the FBI out of Washtub and refers to Pearl Harbor . One was described in a May 1952 OSI memo to the FBI office in Anchorage as the postmaster in Kiana, Alaska; another was manager of a hotel in Valdez. One agent candidate worked for a tin-mining company at Lost River on the Seward Peninsula, one of the higher-priority areas for placing 'Washtub' stay-behind agents. The peninsula is named after Secretary of State William H. Seward, the primary negotiator in the 1867 purchase of the Alaska territory for $7.2 million from czarist Russia. The FBI tapped its local contacts, including federal judges, the head of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Anchorage, an Anchorage physician and others for names of reliable Alaskans to be approached. 'Washtub' was crafted in painstaking detail. But just as the first trained agents were to be put in place in September 1951, Hoover pulled out, leaving it in OSI's hands, even though one month earlier his top lieutenants had advised him the FBI was 'in these programs neck deep,' with an 'obvious and inescapable' duty to proceed. Hoover worried that when the shooting in Alaska started the FBI would be 'left holding the bag.' 'If a crisis arose we would be in the midst of another `Pearl Harbor' and get part of the blame,' Hoover wrote in the margin of a Sept. 6, 1951, memo from an aide, to whom Hoover added one final order: 'Get out at once.' Three years later, Hoover was pulled back in, briefly. In October 1954, an envelope and a typewritten letter containing a coded message were turned over to the FBI by a woman in Anchorage. It had been misaddressed by the anonymous sender in Fairbanks. Espionage was suspected, triggering flurries of FBI internal memos. Hoover was informed that bureau code breakers were urgently trying to decipher the message. They never broke the code but eventually declared the crisis over. The mystery message, they determined, was not from an enemy spy. It was a 'practice message' sent errantly by one of the 'Washtub' agents."}
{"prompt": "One of Britain’s biggest rural police forces will run out of cash to fight crime and protect the public within three years, its chief constable has warned. Neil Rhodes claimed Lincolnshire Police will effectively go out of business if the latest round of cuts takes place. He said the force would be ‘unsustainable’ by 2018, with a shortfall of £10.4million, meaning a fifth of frontline officers would have to be axed. Warning: Neil Rhodes, who leads Lincolnshire Police, (left) has warned Home Secretary Theresa May (right) that his force will collapse within three years unless it gets more cash . In a letter to Home Secretary Theresa May, he said he would have to scrap neighbourhood policing, with bobbies on the beat replaced by ‘just a few’ community support officers. Response times to 999 calls would rise and the ‘range of offences where a meaningful investigation will be possible will reduce’, Mr Rhodes added. Crimes such as theft would have to be largely ignored, and investigations into historic sex abuse and cyber-crime could not be pursued. The officer, who has more than 28 years’ experience, said he would not have spare staff to help at major events or emergencies outside his area. ‘If we were a business, then it would be being funded at below the cost of being in business,’ he said. ‘The cupboard is bare and it is likely that we will be the first force in the country to fall over.’ Last month Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary warned the ability of six forces, including Lincolnshire, Dorset and Suffolk, to provide an effective service would be at risk after cuts left a ‘very thin blue line’. Lincolnshire Police is particularly vulnerable as it covers the third largest area in England and Wales – 2,292 square miles – and has one of the smallest forces, due to the county’s few cities and relatively low population. Support: Mr Rhodes also said his officers would no longer be able to travel the country to support others during major events or emergencies, such as the Olympics or London riots . It has the third highest number of crimes per officer. The force has already cut 1,220 officers to 1,100, but Mr Rhodes said a further 236 frontline staff would have to go. Lincolnshire Police has been criticised in the past for the way it spends money. In 2008 bonuses of £40,000 were shared between three chiefs when the force was rated one of the worst in the country. Blundering officers who put the wrong fuel into police cars ran up a £10,000 repair bill in 2009. And in May this year, the Police Federation attacked the force’s plan to spend £600,000 recruiting 1,000 ‘volunteers’, saying the cash would be better spent hiring 25 frontline officers. But Mr Rhodes claims costs have already been reduced by collaborating with other forces and outsourcing non-frontline roles to private firms such as G4S. ‘In 2016-17 Lincolnshire Police will be … on the edge of viability,’ he wrote. ‘In the following year it will be unsustainable. To cut officer numbers by the amount needed would … compromise both public safety and officer safety.’ Last year, HMIC said it had ‘concerns’ about the force’s ability to maintain services after ‘significant’ budget cuts from 2015/16 with ‘one of the lowest spends on policing, small workforce numbers, low costs and limited further opportunities for economies of scale.’ Yesterday Alan Hardwick, the area’s police and crime commissioner, said: ‘My chief constable tells me that on an average Saturday night at 11pm, he has only 18 constables available to deploy in the city of Lincoln, and only ten in Boston.’ The Government announced a 20 per cent cut in police funding in 2010. The number of officers fell from 141,600 at the general election to 125,400 in March."}

Graham Spanier, the former Penn State University president who stepped down as a result of the Jerry Sandusky child-sex abuse scandal has denied that he ignored any warning signs during his tenure. Citing his own child abuse at the hands of his father, the 64-year-old former family therapist has come out fighting to restore his reputation after an independent report accused him of failing to prevent a 'child predator harming children for over a decade.' Claiming that he does not know, 'anyone who had a higher level of awareness' than himself, Spanier spoke of the terrible injuries that he received at the hands of his father, which resulted in him having four surgeries as an adult to correct the damage to his nose. Scroll Down for Video . Graham Spanier spoke to ABC's Nightline to explain that he did not cover-up Jerry Sandusky's sexual abuse while he was president of Penn State University . 'It resulted in, of course, some emotional scarring, but also some substantial physical damage,' said Spanier to ABC Nightline. Rejecting out of hand the findings of July's damning Freeh Report, Spanier calls its conclusions 'wrong'  and denied outright that 'he conspired to conceal a known child predator'. The former professor said that he was only told that Sandusky had engaged in 'horseplay' with a boy in the team showers in 2001 and that his mind did not automatically think of sexual abuse. The Freeh Report, which was commissioned by Penn State University openly questioned why Spanier failed to begin any investigation into Sandusky's behaviour. Graham Spanier explained that he was very sensitive to any child abuse allegations after suffering physical abuse for years at the hands of his father as a young boy . 'Never in my time as president of . Penn State did I ever receive a report or even a hint that Jerry . Sandusky was engaged in child abuse, a sexual act, criminal activity or . anything resembling that with any child,' said Spanier. 'Had I known that, or even suspected it, I would have forcefully intervened. But I never heard a report like that.' Furthermore, . Spanier told ABC's Nightline that he met Sandusky once only and was not . fully involved with a police investigation into another earlier . incident of child abuse conducted by Sandusky in 1998. 'I . do not get involved in police matters. I always had a very hands-off . attitude and issues pertaining to people were dealt with by the police, . by human resources, or by supervisors in various areas of the . university,' said Spanier of the 1998 incident which at the time led to . no charges against the former defensive coach. However, . during the second 2001 incident, Spanier received an email from . Athletic Director Tim Curley and retired Vice President Gary Shcultz . that spoke of letting Sandusky off with a warning after he was caught . with a boy in the showers. Spanier . agreed to this, but noted in an email that by failing to report it to . the police, they would be 'vulnerable for not having reported it.' Speaking to Nightline, Spanier said that his choice of words was unfortunate and that he had 'no recollection of being concerned' that the school might be leaving itself open to be legally liable. 'I never, ever heard anything about child abuse or sexual abuse or my antennae raised up enough to even suspect that. So I know that’s been taken out of context, and I suspect that whoever leaked those e-mails wanted them to be taken out of context,' said Spanier to the New Yorker Magazine. Graham Spanier told ABC's Nightline that he had little to no recollection of this meeting with Jerry Sandusky and only has one clear memory of ever speaking with him . Penn State president Graham Spanier and his lawyers also attacked the Freeh report on the Jerry Sandusky sex abuse scandal on Wednesday, calling it a 'blundering and indefensible indictment' as they fired a pre-emptive strike while waiting to hear if he'll be charged in the case. Lawyer Timothy Lewis called Louis Freeh, the former FBI director and federal judge behind the report, a 'biased investigator' who piled speculation on top of innuendo to accuse Spanier in a cover-up of early abuse complaints. 'The Freeh report, as it pertains to Dr. Spanier, is a myth. And that myth ... ends today,' Lewis said at a downtown Philadelphia news conference. Spanier did not attend. But he told media outlets in stories published hours later that he never understood the early complaints about Sandusky, who this year was convicted of molesting 10 boys, to be sexual. Guilty: Graham Spanier's once pristine reputation has been ruined after a damning report accused him of conspiring to protect defensive . coordinator Jerry Sandusky, who was convicted in June of multiple pedophilia charges . 'I'm very stunned by Freeh's conclusion that - I don't think he used the word `cover-up'; but he uses the word `concealed,'' Spanier told The New Yorker magazine. 'Why on earth would anybody cover up for a known child predator? Adverse publicity? For heaven's sake! Every day I had to make some decision that got adverse publicity.' Spanier told ABC that he was told only that Sandusky had been seen engaging in 'horseplay' in a campus shower with a boy and he took that to mean 'throwing water around, snapping towels.' 'I wish in hindsight that I would have known more about Jerry Sandusky and his terrible, terrible hidden past so that I could have intervened because it would have been my instinct to do so,' he said. The New Yorker interview was published online after ABC News began promoting its own interview with Spanier, set to air in parts on several of its networks Wednesday and Thursday. Sick: Sandusky (left, seen here in 1990) was . involved in a local charity which he went on to use as a way to find the . boys that he would 'groom' to be his victims . At the news conference, Lewis, also a former federal judge, complained that Freeh never interviewed key witnesses, ignored inconvenient facts and manipulated the truth. For instance, he said, the report assumes former graduate assistant Mike McQueary told coach Joe Paterno in 2001 that he saw something sexual in a locker room shower and that Paterno echoed that to athletic director Tim Curley and vice president Gary Schultz. Freeh likewise, he said, assumes that they in turn told Spanier the same thing. 'Curley and Schultz have denied that they ever told Dr. Spanier anything of the sort,' Lewis said. '`Horseplay' was referred to over and over again, but never with any sexual connotation or suggestion of abuse. But Judge Freeh paid no attention to that.' The Freeh group said Wednesday that it stands by its report. Its investigation uncovered documents that suggest Spanier had deeper knowledge of the early Sandusky complaints, including an email in which the president appeared to agree with Curley's decision to keep a 2001 assault from child-welfare authorities and instead work directly with Sandusky and Sandusky's charity for at-risk youths. Timothy Lewis, defense lawyer for former Penn State President Graham Spanier, speaks during a news conference Wednesday, Aug. 22, 2012, in Philadelphia . The 'Freeh Report' also pointed a finger at legendary football coach Joe Paterno who is accused of being complicit with Spanier in ignoring Sandusky's actions . 'The only downside for us is if the message isn't `heard' and acted upon, and we then become vulnerable for not having reported it,' said Spanier's email, dated Feb. 27, 2001. 'The approach you outline is humane and a reasonable way to proceed.' Spanier's four high-profile lawyers, who are being paid by Penn State, argue that Freeh took the email out of context. As for a 1998 report that Sandusky had showered with a boy - a complaint that led to a campus police investigation referred to county prosecutors - they note that prosecutors declined to charge Sandusky. 'There was thus nothing to conceal,' the lawyers wrote in a rebuttal to the report released Wednesday. Spanier and Paterno were ousted in November, days after Sandusky was charged. Sandusky, who maintains his innocence, awaits sentencing. Beaver Stadium: Much of Penn State University's growth and success over the past 50 years has derived from its stellar performances on the football field . Gone: The site outside Beaver Stadium where Joe . Paterno's statue once stood has been stripped of all monuments after . workers uprooted the statue honouring the late coach . Curley and Schultz are charged with perjury and failing to report suspected child abuse; they maintain their innocence, and their attorneys issued statements after Wednesday's broadcast also blasting the Freeh report. Spanier's lawyers said they don't know whether he will be charged. 'That's out of our control,' lawyer Jack Riley said. A spokesman in the attorney general's office has declined to comment on possible charges, while calling the Sandusky probe 'ongoing and active.' Former Penn State athletic director Tim Curley (left) and retired Vice President Gary Shcultz are facing charges relating to perjury as a result of what they knew regarding Jerry Sandusky's abuse . University trustee Anthony Lubrano, who attended the law firm news conference, said the board has never adopted Freeh's report, unlike current university President Rodney Erickson. 'I'd love for us to come out with a statement that says, we've never accepted this report,' Lubrano said. With Erickson's approval, the university has agreed to pay $60 million in NCAA fines over the scandal. Spanier, who remains a tenured faculty member at Penn State, has told trustees he would never cover up abuse because he himself had been physically abused as a boy by his father, as a form of discipline. 'Someday I hope to have my name completely cleared when it becomes evident that this was unfair and untrue,' Spanier told The New Yorker."}
{"prompt": "By . Zoe Szathmary . The death of a woman working at an Amazon warehouse in Pennsylvania is being investigated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the agency said in a Friday press release, as it cited five companies for 'serious' violations after an investigation into a worker's death last year at a New Jersey facility. Jody Rhoads, 52, died on June 1 from wounds she suffered when the pallet jack she 'was operating [...] crashed into shelving and pinned her,' the Associated Press reported. Rhoads, a widow who earlier survived a battle with breast cancer, left behind two sons and four grandchildren, her obituary said. Killed: Jody Rhoads, pictured, died earlier this month from wounds she suffered while working at an Amazon warehouse . The citations came after an investigation into the December 2013 death of temporary Amazon worker Ronald Smith at an Avenel, New Jersey facility, OSHA said in the release. Smith 'was caught in between a conveyor system and crushed while performing sorting operations' and later died, the agency said. The 57-year-old man left behind four children and seven grandchildren, NJ.com reported. Victim: Ronald Smith, pictured, was killed in December 2013 after he was crushed by equipment at an Amazon warehouse in New Jersey . Four staffing agencies, along with logistics company Genco, were cited for 'serious' violations, which '[occur] when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known,' OSHA said. The staffing agencies were cited 'for failure to perform a hazard assessment of the facility before assigning employees to determine if hazards existed.' Genco was cited 'for not certifying that a hazard assessment of the facility had been conducted before assigning employees to work.' Four staffing agencies, along with logistics company Genco, were cited for 'serious' violations by OSHA stemming from an investigation into Smith's death . 'Temporary staffing agencies and host employers are jointly responsible for the safety and health of temporary employees,' Patricia Jones, the director of the OSHA Avenel Area Office, said in the release. 'These employers must assess the work site to ensure that workers are adequately protected from potential hazards. It is essential that employers protect all workers from job hazards - both temporary and permanent workers.' All five companies face a $6,000 fine. Amazon has so far not been cited by OSHA."}
{"prompt": "(CNN) -- An opposition plan calling for an investigation into violence against protesters in Yemen and the  departure of the president was being reviewed by the ruling party, a government official said, and was \"being received positively\" so far. The government official, who asked not to be named, told CNN late Wednesday the plan was being \"reviewed by the GPC (Ruling Party) leadership committee.\" The official's comments came as the ruling party claimed that it is continuing a dialogue with the opposition -- but the opposition denied it. \"We will not have any dialogue with the ruling party. Our only demand is that this regime leaves and then we can talk about dialogue,\" said opposition bloc spokesman Mohammed Al-Qubati. The two sides both said that the opposition delivered a list of five points to the ruling party via a committee of Islamic scholars, but did not agree on whether it was a \"plan,\" as the government says, or \"advice for the ruling party,\" as the opposition says. Opponents of Yemen's long-time President Ali Abdullah Saleh have been demonstrating against him since the beginning of the year, part of the wave of popular protests that has been crashing over the Arab world. Saleh's party says the opposition \"points\" include a demand for an investigation into who was responsible for violence against protesters, and prosecutions, plus compensation for the victims' families. They also want Saleh to step down and transfer power peacefully by the end of the year, according to the official. Saleh caused a stir Tuesday when he said in a public address that \"there is a control room working for the media and you know where it is -- in Tel Aviv. These events are managed by the White House.\" The comments referring to Washington were later edited out of a rebroadcast of his speech. Saleh called the White House on Wednesday \"to convey his regret for misunderstandings related to his public remarks that Israel and the United States have engaged in destabilizing activities in Arab countries,\" a White House statement said. In the call to John Brennan, U.S. President Barack Obama's assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism, Saleh also said that he is \"firmly committed to meaningful political reform in Yemen and that he is reaching out to opposition elements in an effort to achieve reform through a democratic, inclusive, and peaceful process.\" U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley rejected Saleh's remarks before the Yemeni leader retracted them. \"The protests in Yemen are not the product of external conspiracies,\" Crowley said on Twitter. \"President Saleh knows better. His people deserve a better response.\" Saleh's stinging comments came as a powerful cleric -- labeled a terrorist by the United States -- joined the ranks of the Yemeni protesters Tuesday, leading them in prayer and telling them to stick to their demands. It marked the first time a radical Islamic voice had joined those calling for democracy. Sheikh Abdul Majid al-Zindani, a provocative cleric with a flaming red beard, was accused by Washington in 2004 of supplying weapons to al Qaeda. Last year, al-Zindani made a public plea to recruit millions of young men to fight jihad against Israel. But in Yemen, al-Zindani is a free and influential man and his support of the demonstrations could prove key. Saleh also fired the governors of five of the nation's provinces, where anti-government protests have been raging for several weeks. All five were appointed to other positions, according to a decree released Tuesday. The protests continued Tuesday as thousands gathered outside Sanaa University in the capital. Even members of Saleh's powerful tribal group were among the protesters calling for an end to the president's rule. In a counterdemonstration, thousands of government loyalists descended on Sanaa's Tahrir Square. Opposition to Saleh has solidified in the wake of violent confrontations between security forces and protesters Friday in Sanaa, Aden and elsewhere. Four people were killed and 26 were wounded in the clashes, according to medical officials. Amnesty International said it had reports that 11 people died in Friday's protests, bringing the overall death toll since protests began to 27. Saleh, in power since 1978, has already said he will not seek re-election but his attempts to form a unity government have run into roadblocks. The country's main opposition bloc rejected Saleh's call for calm until elections to replace him are held.

The reception was hosted by British ambassador Fiona Clouder, and attended by local dignitaries from business, the arts and politics. Radio presenter Virginia Araya said that she had asked Harry about his nephew during the event. 'I asked him what George was like,' she said. 'He said: \"He's growing up, he is walking and he has big, chubby cheeks. He looks like a young Winston Churchill.\"' Temper: Like Churchill, George can show flashes of an outspoken temperament .

{"prompt": "(CNN) -- A federal jury on Monday convicted an Arkansas doctor in a February 2009 car bomb attack on the head of the state's medical board, according to the U.S. attorney's office. Randeep Mann will face up to life in prison when he is sentenced later, said Cherith Beck, spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Arkansas. Court records show Mann's trial began July 6. Jurors convicted Mann on seven counts, including using a weapon of mass destruction against a person and property, and using an explosive resulting in personal injury. Dr. Trent Pierce, a family practitioner, suffered serious injuries in the attack and lost an eye, but survived. He was leaving his home in West Memphis, Arkansas, headed to his clinic when a bomb went off as he approached his Lexus hybrid SUV. The blast, heard a mile away, threw Pierce 6 feet into a flower bed. KARK reports on the Arkansas bombing . Mann, whose specialty was internal medicine and pain management, had \"multiple disciplinary matters\" before the state medical board, federal prosecutors said. Early in the investigation, authorities focused on cases before the board, which oversees licensing of those in medical professions and can discipline professionals by suspending or revoking their licenses in some cases. Mann's wife, Sangeeta \"Sue\" Mann, was convicted of conspiring with her husband to conceal evidence and obstruct the investigation, Beck said. She will face up to 20 years in prison when she is sentenced. Authorities said Mann was interviewed by federal agents on the day of the bombing and showed them \"at least one grenade launcher he legally owned.\" However, he was not arrested until a month later, when city employees found partially buried \"high explosive rounds designed to be fired from a grenade launcher\" in a wooded area of London, Arkansas, authorities said. Jurors convicted Mann of possession of 98 unregistered grenades and two counts of possessing machine guns, but acquitted him of possessing an unregistered 12-gauge shotgun. Sangeeta Mann was acquitted of lying to a grand jury investigating the unregistered firearms."}
{"prompt": "(CNN) -- A young black man runs with the ball at his feet, living out his dream of playing on the world stage. Around him, amidst an intimidating, vicious atmosphere, the noises begin. First, the boos, then the monkey noises. The incessant chanting, the vitriolic abuse, the gestures and then, the indignity of receiving punishment for having the temerity to stand your ground. Welcome to Serbia 2012, or should that be Bristol 1909? Racism row shines light on Serbian football . At first glance, Walter Tull, an officer in the British Army during the First World War and England Under-21 footballer Danny Rose appear to have little in common. Rose is a successful Premier League footballer, at the start of a promising career, which he hopes will see him become a full international. Before he was killed in the Great War, Tull was a pioneering black footballer, who blazed a trail for black stars of the future such as Brendan Batson, Laurie Cunningham, Viv Anderson and Cyril Regis. One man is on our television screen with pictures being sent around the world, the other has no grave, only an inscription on the memorial wall at the Fauborg-Amiens war cemetery and memorial at Arras. Black pioneer . But Tull's story, recorded some 93 years ago, could not be more apt given what Rose was forced to endure in Krusevac. While most were left stunned by Rose being sent off for his reaction to being targeted by racist chanting, the tale is all too familiar for those who know their history. Tull became the first black outfield player to to compete in the top-flight of the English league after signing for Tottenham Hotspur in 1909. Like Rose, he too suffered racial abuse from the stands with his career almost disappearing from history and public consciousness. Lazio hit by UEFA racism fine . That it didn't is largely thanks to two men, writer and producer Phil Vasili and director David Thacker, who are taking Tull's story to the stage and eventually the big screen. While the film surrounding Tull's life is scheduled to coincide with 2014's 100th anniversary of the Great War, the play will open in February in Bolton. \"I think the play will be very topical,\" said Vasili, author of the biography Walter Tull, 1888-1918: Officer, Footballer. \"It's quite poignant that the play should start so soon given what happened to Rose in Serbia. \"What happened to Rose, happened to Walter around 93 years previously and both were victimized twice. \"Rose was racially abused and then sent off, Walter was also abused before being dropped by Tottenham and eventually sold. \"Both men were punished twice. It's funny how something which happened nearly a century ago could be so relevant.\" Terry decides against appealing FA racism verdict . If it wasn't for Vasili's work the story of the man who changed the face of football for black Britons could have been confined to the scrapheap of history. Although Arthur Wharton, a goalkeeper from Ghana, was the first professional black player to have competed at the top level in England, it is Tull who is credited with being a pioneer as he was the first black outfield player. Giant strides . Initially Vasili's attempts to get publishers or media outlets interested in Tull's story appeared to hit a dead end. \"I first came across him in 1993 and there was nothing contemporary about him, he had almost become forgotten,\" Vasili recalled. \"In the first years, I couldn't get anyone interested in it. Over time, the interest has grown and he's now got publicity. \"With the play and the film, we're hoping to show people that whatever obstacles you face, you can achieve the things you strive for. \"On a political level, things are never simplistic. Britain may have been a different place for black people at that time and there was prejudice. \"But at the same time, there were a number of progressive institutions and people who helped the black community and Walter on their way. Cameron hosts talks on football racism . \"Symbolically, Britain has been a multicultural place for a long time. Tull had a black father and a white mother and if you look at the number of mixed-race footballers, he led the way for them.\" But what would Tull have made of the recent events in Serbia? And what would he have though of the John Terry racism saga that has proved so divisive for English footall over the last year? \"I think he would have been very sad,\" said Vasili. \"Britain is a different place today than it was when Walter was alive and there have been giant strides. \"He was the only black outfield player in the top division at one time and now that isn't the case. He was a great role model and led the way for those that play today.\" Football pioneer: Andrew Watson - the first black international . Tull, who was born in Folkestone, Kent, on April 28, 1888, endured a difficult childhood with illness, death and poverty plaguing the family. The grandson of slaves in Barbados, his father arrived in England in 1876 following abolition some 43 years earlier. Walter's mother, Alice, died when he was just seven before his father passed away two years later. With all six children surviving their parents' death, the demands on their stepmother, Clara, were too much to bear and Tull along with his brother Edward were taken to live in a Methodist orphanage in Bethnal Green, east London. When Edward was adopted two years later by a couple from Glasgow and went on to become the first black dentist in the city, Walter turned to football to help with his solitude. It was here, while training to be a printer, Walter caught the eye with his football skills and soon won a trial with amateur side Clapton F.C. Vitriolic racism . His success, which helped the club win the Amateur Cup, London Senior Cup and London County Amateur Cup in the 1908-1909 season, secured him a dream move to Tottenham Hotspur. The transfer made Walter just the second black professional player in the English top division and the first outfield player. After making his debut at the age of 21, Walter enjoyed success at Tottenham until a vitriolic episode of racism at Bristol City in October 1909. Crime and punishment in sport: Laying down the law? \"The game at Bristol was the first time I came across racism being mentioned in a match report,\" said Vasili. \"In previous reports, writers would use coded language such as 'Tull took unwarranted abuse' but there was no hiding it in this Bristol game.\" The Football Star described the Bristol City fans racist chants as \"lower than Billingsgate\", while another newspaper labeled it as \"a cowardly attack\". One reporter vented his fury by writing, \"Let me tell those Bristol hooligans that Tull is so clean in his mind and method as to be a model for all white men who play football.\" The episode appeared to embarrass Tottenham, which promptly dropped Tull from the team and sold him to Northampton Town. Under Herbert Chapman, the future manager of Arsenal, Walter enjoyed great success, making 110 appearances and attracting the interest of Scottish giants Glasgow Rangers. The First World War broke out in 1914, with Tull signing up to the 17th Service Battalion of the Middlesex Regiment, which was nicknamed, \"The Diehards\". Cole apologizes for outburst over Terry racism case . He was involved in combat at the end of the Battle of the Somme between October and November 1916, before being sent back to England suffering from trench foot and shell shock. After making a full recovery, Walter was ordered to go up to Scotland to the Officer Training Corps, despite military regulations forbidding those who were not of \"pure European descent\" from becoming officers. Military bravery . In May 1917, he was appointed an officer, despite it being technically illegal. \"I guess he never received the medal because the rules at the time prohibited it,\" added Vasili. \"Perhaps those on the ground didn't realize and some civil servant or bureaucrat must have pointed it out. \"They couldn't have given an award to a black soldier and not a white soldier at the time.\" Walter's military success continued as he became the first black officer in the British Army to lead troops into battle. In Italy, he led his men at the Battle of Piave and was commended for his outstanding leadership abilities by his peers. Walter's efforts did not go unnoticed and he was recommended for the Military Cross, but never received it. Chelsea defender Cole charged with misconduct after abusive tweet . After finishing in Italy, Walter was transferred to the Somme Valley in France. It was on March 25, 1918 while trying to escape a German advance at Favreuil, that he was fatally injured by machine gun fire. \"Such was Walter's bond with his men that even with the machine guns firing, his men still tried to recover his body,\" said Vasili. \"They risked their lives to try and bring him back because he was a person who they all looked up to and respected. He was a very humble character, who wanted to be judged by his actions and deeds. \"I think that his Methodist background gave him a code to live by and helped guide him through life.\" Tull, the play, is at the Octagon Theatre in Bolton from February 21 and March 16."}

Accused: Mick Philpott, pictured with Mairead Philpott on their wedding day, joked about the night of the fatal blaze to a police officer just a week later, a court has heard . A father accused of killing his six children in a house fire joked about the night of the fatal blaze to a police officer just a week later, a court has heard. PC Joanne Halford told Nottingham Crown Court that Michael Philpott, 56, seemed 'jovial' when she spoke to him at Royal Derby Hospital in the early hours of May 18. She told jurors: 'He was laughing and joking about the incident saying that when he was trying to rescue the children he had took his chance to hit out at two coppers trying to hold him back.' Mick Philpott and his wife Mairead are on trial for the manslaughter of their six children along with a third defendant Paul Mosley following a fire at their house in Allenton, Derby, on May 11 last year. A week after the fire, which the three are accused of setting to frame Philpott’s former mistress Lisa Willis, PC Halford said she met Philpott at the hospital, where the bodies of the youngsters were being held, at around 1.30am. The police constable told the court that when she asked him what he was doing at the hospital, Philpott said to her 'I’m here to see you gorgeous. Paul Mosley’s brother Brian, who was with Philpott, asked PC Halford: 'Don’t you know who he is? He’s Mick Philpott, father of the six dead kids.' She told the court the statement seemed to be used like a 'badge of honour'. Richard Latham QC asked her: 'How was that statement being used to you?' PC Halford replied: 'I describe it as a badge of honour'. Philpott alleged that neighbour Adam Taylor, who was later arrested and released without charge, had set the blaze because he had borrowed a strimmer and a petrol can from him two weeks before the fire and had failed to return the petrol can. Deadly blaze: Philpott surrounded by the six children whose lives were claimed by the fatal house fire last May . He also told her that he was angry police had asked him about his family background and that it was none of their business, PC Halford told the court. She said he was 'cross' that his wife Mairead had disclosed information to them, including about threesomes the couple had in the past. PC Halford told the court that when she returned from phoning the information Philpott had given her to her colleagues, Philpott seemed 'jovial' in an office inside the hospital. 'He was jovial, laughing and jolly with the other men in there,' she told the court. Scene: Flowers are left outside the house where the children died in the fire . The police constable also told the court Philpott inferred that he would like her to join him at the hotel where he and Mairead were staying following the fire at their home. The court also heard evidence from a family friend who said she saw Mosley and Philpott at the hospital on the night of the fire on May 11. Claire Smith said she saw co-accused Mosley arrive at the hospital and thought it was Philpott’s brother. 'He does look very similar to Mick and I thought he was Mick’s brother', Ms Smith told the court this morning. She said she saw the pair go down the side of Royal Derby Hospital away from everybody else for about half an hour. 'Was anyone else with them?', Mr Latham asked her. 'No', Ms Smith replied. 'Could you hear what they were saying?', Mr Latham asked. 'No,' she replied. Ms Smith told the court it seemed strange to her, when Philpott already knew he had lost five of his children and that his surviving son Duwayne was fighting for his life. Giving evidence she said: 'You have just lost your five children. You’ve got your other one in the hospital. Everyone reacts differently but me on my hand, why would I want to go and talk to my friend for half and hour when my son is lying in hospital fighting for his life.' Ms Smith told the court Mrs Philpott seemed very distressed when she saw her at the hospital.'She was very distressed. Like anyone would be when they’ve lost their children. She was very upset.' The court also heard Mosley offered his cousin Steve Owen money to get him 'out of' Derby when he saw him last year. Giving evidence this afternoon, Mr Owen told the court he had had little contact with his cousin since 2001 but had seen him in the street in Alvaston last September. On Trial: Mick Philpott and his wife Mairead (pictured here at a press conference after the fatal fire) are on trial for the manslaughter of their six children, along with a third defendant Paul Mosley, following a fire at their house . The meeting came after Mosley was first arrested and released by police in June last year in connection with the fire. Jurors heard Mosley asked his cousin why he had been arrested in connection with the case.Mr Owen told the court: 'He told me he never did anything but that he knew more than the police knew about it'. He said Mosley offered him £10,000 to take him out of Derby and claimed he had been given the money by a national newspaper for his story. Mr Owen said he didn't believe his cousin until he saw reports that Mosley had been charged on Sky News. He told the court he then went to the police. In his police statement, Mr Owen said during the meeting in September Mosley had also told him he was 'at the scene' when the fire was started. He said in his statement that Mosley was 'there at the time the fire was started, then left and then came back', the court heard. Mr Owen also told police Mosley had said he knew 'more about the incident than the police.'Mosley was rearrested and charged in November. Prosecutors have alleged Mosley, with the Philpotts, set the fire at the couple's house to frame Philpott's former mistress Lisa Willis. Miss Willis left the three-bedroomed house she shared with the Philpotts and their children in February, taking her five children with her. Jurors have heard Philpott was due to attend a custody hearing with Miss Willis to discuss residency of the five children, four of which he had fathered, on the day of the blaze. The trial was adjourned until tomorrow morning. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons."}

{"prompt": "Bryan Barkley, who staged a solo protest against same sex marriage in March . A volunteer has been dismissed from the British Red Cross for protesting against gay marriage. Bryan Barkley, 71, was told he is no longer welcome at the charity because his views are incompatible with its values. The church-going pensioner received his dismissal letter after holding a one-man protest outside his local cathedral. He held up a placard saying ‘No same sex marriage’ and ‘No redefinition of marriage’. Yesterday his supporters said the charity’s action was shocking and it was punishing volunteers for their thoughts and views. Mr Barkley, who has worked for 20 years as a senior Red Cross volunteer, is appealing against his dismissal which he calls ‘unfair and without justification’. The grandfather, who has been married for 42 years, joined the organisation after taking early retirement from his job as a civil engineer and had recently represented it at a Buckingham Palace garden party. He said yesterday: ‘What have I done wrong? I passionately believe that the institution of marriage is between a man and a woman and is the cornerstone of our society. Why is it wrong to say so in public? ‘Freedom of expression is being stifled in this country. I have nothing against homosexuals. But I don’t believe Parliament was representing the views of the people when it changed the definition of marriage.’ Mr Barkley, from Wakefield, West Yorkshire, worked for the charity’s international tracing service helping reunite families in Britain with relatives in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa. He staged his protest outside Wakefield Cathedral in March. It was reported in the local press and Pink News but his link to the Red Cross was not mentioned. However, in May he received a letter from Andy Peers, director of operations for the charity in Yorkshire, summoning him to a disciplinary hearing. The letter said it was to discuss his protest in relation to the ‘fundamental principles of the Red Cross, Red Crescent Movement and the values of the British Red Cross’. During the meeting, Mr Peers told Mr Barkley that the British Red Cross does not have a view on same sex marriage because as a charity it is impartial and neutral. Yet on August 8, Mr Barkley was told the charity was withdrawing his ‘opportunity to volunteer’ with immediate effect. The letter of dismissal accused him of breaching its principles. Coalition for Marriage, which co-ordinated opposition to gay marriage, is providing Mr Barkley with legal advice. Its director, Colin Hart, said: ‘This is a shocking case. Mr Barkley held the protest outside his local cathedral in Wakefield earlier this year . ‘For nearly two decades Bryan helped reunite people with lost family members. ‘Yet after voicing his opposition to the Government’s plans to rip up the traditional definition of marriage he was fired. ‘His only crime seems to be that he was one of millions of ordinary people who opposed this change. What will disturb most people is that the Red Cross says it is not his actions but his thoughts and views that were the problem. ‘Is it now official policy of the Red Cross that any volunteer who holds traditional views on marriage will face the sack?’ The Red Cross said: ‘We are committed to and bound by our fundamental principles which... do not take sides in controversies of a political, racial, religious or ideological nature. ‘We have to consider the compatibility of people’s publicly expressed views in line with the fundamental principles.’"}
{"prompt": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Many Americans are finding ways to trim their holiday budgets this year, but reports are showing that buying video games is one place consumers are not cutting back. Through November, video game sales are up 22 percent over 2007. According to market researcher NPD Group, U.S. retail sales of video games totaled $2.91 billion in November, a 10 percent jump from a year ago. Overall sales this year through November are more than $16 billion, up 22 percent from 2007. Anita Frazier, an analyst from NPD, cites the industry's wide content variety on newer generation consoles such as Nintendo's Wii, Sony's Playstation 3 and Microsoft's XBOX 360 as a reason for the strong performance. Frazier also says that video games are a relatively cheap form of entertainment, considering the hours of value they provide. Matt Helgeson, senior editor at Game Informer magazine, agrees. \"Video games can take between 10 and 40 hours, sometimes 50 hours, to complete\" depending on the title, Helgeson said. \"Gamers can often get two to three months out of one game.\" Furthermore, during these recessionary times, Helgeson explains that video games \"provide the ultimate escapism.\" According to NPD, some of the top-selling game titles in November include \"Gears of War 2,\" which sold 1.6 million copies, and \"Call Of Duty: World At War,\" which sold 1.4 million. Nintendo's \"Wii Play\" and \"Wii Fit\" put up impressive numbers, as well. With those kinds of sales, video games have potential to be one of the most popular stocking stuffers for kids this holiday season. Helgeson says that these days, games are a core part of being a kid, and it's no longer a question of \"do you play video games?\" Instead the question is \"what games are you playing?\" \"Ages, races, social groups -- video games cut across all platforms,\" Helgeson said. Whether you're shopping for a hardcore gamer or something for the family, \"there is something for everybody.\""}

Weaved out of living tree roots, this rickety bridge set just a few feet above a treacherously fast-flowing river looks like it could be from a scene in an Indiana Jones film. But this unique living tree root bridge called 'Jembatan Akar' is actually a vital link to connect the residents of two tiny villages in Pesisir Selatan District, West Sumatra, Indonesia. The bridge was created by weaving a combination of roots into two Kubang trees placed on either side of the Bayang River that gradually grew strong enough over the course of 26 years for the residents of of Pulut-pulut and Lubuak Glare to use it as a crossing. Vital link: The root bridge is used to connect the two villages of Pulut-pulut and Lubuak Glare as the previous bamboo bridges were all destroyed by the river . A living tree bridge: Tourists cross the 'Jembatan Akar' root bridge in Bayang Village, Pesisir Selatan District, West Sumatra, Indonesia . Unique: The rickety tree bridge, which has been constricted a couple of feet over the fast-flowing Bayang River, is used to connect the residents of two tiny villages on either side . For more than 100 years, families have used the 30 metre bridge to reach one another, trade supplies and connect and it is now a mainstay tourist attraction of the province. The incredible engineering was captured by amateur photographer Robertus Pudyanto who visited the villages with help from the locals. Robertus said: 'The root bridge is frequently visited by tourists during the holidays or before Eid as they are considered sacred. 'They are extremely vital to the villagers and their entire lives depend on them. 'The creations are remarkable but you have to be careful when walking on them in the rain as they become slippery - and that's not good when hovering five metres over a fast-flowing river.' Ancient: The 30 metre bridge took 26 years to fully form over the Bayang River and has been used ever since for the last 100 years . Dangerous: Crossing the bridge can be dangerous when it is raining as the water makes it slippery . Woven together: The roots are woven across the river to Kubang trees growing on either side . Root bridges were first created by Muslim Ulama named Pakih Sohan and have been used in the region since 1890. The construction process takes approximately 26 years. They were created after original bamboo bridges were battered and broken by the Bayang River's torrential currents. The process of creating the bridge begins by stringing together tree roots along a stem bridge made of bamboo. They then strengthen and grow over time into a bridge strong enough to cross. Around the base of the bridge, there are thousands Larangan fish that are also considered sacred and are forbidden to be fished or taken. According to local belief, when residents bathe in the Bayang River around the root bridge their hopes and wishes to find love and better fortune will be granted by God. Sacred: Local legend suggests that swimming in the Bayang River around the root bridge will grant the bather their wishes for love and fortune . Mainstay: The root bridge in Bayang Village, Pesisir Selatan District, West Sumatra, Indonesia, is now a popular tourist attraction for people visiting the region .

Unless you count grey,  the May Day bank holiday offered little in the way of colour. But these spectacular azaleas did at least brighten up one girl’s afternoon during a miserable, dank weekend. Lily Manning, eight, made her way through the colourful display at Exbury Gardens in the New Forest, Hampshire, as the rest of the country sheltered under umbrellas. Shrubbing up nicely: Eight-year-old Lily Manning marvels at the brightly coloured azaleas at Exbury Gardens in the New Forest, on what was a largely overcast spring weekend . Heavy rain across large parts of Britain and below-average temperatures have led some to speculate that we are on course for the coldest start to May in 70 years. And few who did venture out yesterday would dare to disagree. As temperatures failed to get anywhere near the 16c (61f) average for this time of year, the beach resorts of Brighton and Bournemouth were all but deserted. One Bournemouth tourist, Sarah Slade, 38, from Milton Keynes, said: ‘When I booked a mini-break at the seaside for the May bank holiday I had hoped to pack my bikini and suntan lotion. Instead I’ve had to dig out some of my winter clothing. It feels like February, not May.’ Tesco said that umbrella sales were up by 2,580 per cent from this time last year – when the skies were blue and the heat rivalled anything in the Mediterranean – while sales of wellington boots rose by 256 per cent. ‘This time last year we were out in our gardens enjoying barbecue food but the miserable weather has had shoppers stocking up on the kind of food they would normally buy in mid-winter,’ said Karen Poole, a manager at the supermarket. The total cost of the weekend wash-out to Britain’s tourism industry is yet to be calculated, but is expected to run into tens of millions of pounds. Visitor numbers to the Thomas Cook website have soared by 27 per cent in a week, as Britons look for warmer weather abroad.

{"prompt": "(CNN) -- The atmosphere could have fallen a little flat after the Champions League setback against Real Madrid, but it did not stop a capacity 71,000 crowd at the Allianz Arena celebrating Bayern Munich's 24th Bundesliga title in traditional style Saturday. A last-gasp winner from Claudio Pizarro ensured the final league game of the season would result in a 1-0 win over Stuttgart and the cue for the party to start. Manager Pep Guardiola was dowsed with the best Bavarian beer as has become the custom, with defenders Jerome Boateng and Daniel van Buyten the main protagonists. He scarcely seemed to mind as he lifted the shield, reward for an all-conquering season which saw the championship wrapped up by March and with 29 wins, three draws and only two defeats. Some have blamed the early clinching of the title for some lackluster performances which followed, including the 5-0 semifinal aggregate reverse to Real which ended Bayern's hopes of defending the Champions League crown. The last league game was also a low-key affair on the pitch until Peru's Pizarro scored from outside the penalty area in the 92nd minute. Guardiola, whose future at Bayern has been the subject of some speculation, looked a relieved man after it went in, but he will be hoping his team can raise themselves for one final big performance next week. They face arch-rivals Borussia Dortmund in the German Cup final in Berlin, hoping to complete the domestic double before many of their squad head to Brazil for the World Cup finals. Bayern may have to do so without key midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger, who limped off in the first half with a knee injury. He will undergo an MRI scan Monday to determine the seriousness, worrying for his club side and Germany. \"Bastian has a problem with his kneecap,\" Guardiola told the official Bayern website. \"But we still have six days to go until the cup final.\" Guardiola also reflected on his team's achievements in his first season in charge. \"The first championship is very special for a Catalan such as myself,\" he said."}

It took the 27-year-old just two minutes into the Barclays Premier League of 2015 to remind us why it's the best there is (and why Bundesliga and La Liga can keep their winter breaks). January 1 had just about everything; goals, penalties, red cards, talking points, a twist or two, a Jose Mourinho rant, and more than a few questionable refereeing decisions.

Frank Lampard's goals against Sunderland, Leicester City and Chelsea have been vital in the title chase . Manuel Pellegrini is using Mourinho's own weapon against him after the 36-year-old was allowed to leave Stamford Bridge in June,  ending up in Manchester via New York. The former England midfielder's goals against Sunderland, Leicester City and Chelsea mean he has earned Pellegrini five points, and denied Mourinho two in the process. But there's good news for Chelsea. When Arsenal were tied with Manchester United on points, goals for, goals against and difference on January 10, 2004, Arsene Wenger went on to win the title. If Chelsea and Manchester City's records remain identical come May, then both sides would need a one-off winner-takes-all match to determine the champions. Fingers crossed, neutrals. Manuel Pellegrini has been using Mourinho's own weapon against him with the on-loan Lampard (right) There were 33 goals scored, the most  on New Year's Day since 1987 . Largely down to the evening's London derby between Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea, where  neutrals (and BT Sport) were relieved it was on television. And the five goals between Manchester City and Sunderland in their 3-2 thriller helped, too, all coming in just 16 minutes and 12 seconds. The early game, sadly, did not become a free-for-all, not even with Manchester United's £154million attack, but others made up for it. The 10 fixtures had 33 between them, the most since 1987 when 11 matches saw 34, including a 3-1 win for Oxford United over Southampton and a 3-1 defeat for Wimbledon by Arsenal. New Year's Day almost doubled the amount of goals on December 28, too, where just 17 goals were scored and three 0-0 scorelines played out. Not the worst of welcomes to the new year.

Among those was Peter Crouch who could have nicked a win for Stoke City in the second half. You can try and mark the 6ft 7in striker, though it often does little good. He rose highest, but could not been the right post. At St James' Park, too, there could have been more than the six goals scored between Newcastle United and Burnley. The latter were desperately unlucky, hitting the woodwork  twice in one move through Danny Ings and Ashley Barnes during the 3-3 draw.

This doesn't happen. Mourinho doesn't allow teams he manages to concede five. To him, three is an disappointment. Four, an embarrassment. But five? That's what happened at White Hart Lane, largely down to their in-house striker. Harry Kane, shaking loose Oscar, scored from where he had no right to. It brought Tottenham level, and they went on to win 5-3. The only other time Mourinho  felt this was on November 29, 2010. He, then of Real Madrid, lost 5-0 against Barcelona at the Nou Camp. 'I hope this game does not affect us psychologically,' Mourinho said in the aftermath. 'I have spoken to the players and told them the title is not gone. We can't leave here crying.'

When else did Liverpool surrender a two-goal lead? Against Newcastle, when Gary Speed and Alan Shearer scored late goals, and Birmingham City after a Clinton Morison brace.

But schadenfreude can be a funny thing. Some of them, so ridiculous, that they were laughable. Take, for example, poor old Wes Morgan. The Leicester City defender takes one to the face from Raheem Sterling, then hears Mike Jones blow his whistle for  a penalty. Referees aren't held accountable for their mistakes in the modern game, and this is where common sense should prevail. It is calling for officials to be allowed to speak after games, whether to apologise for a decision or explain it. They're only human after all.

The final autopsy report for Chicago chef Charlie Trotter has been released, revealing that he died due to a stroke. The 54-year-old chef was found dead in his Chicago home by his young son earlier this month, and now the medical examiner's office has given more information about the chef's health problems. They concluded that he 'died of a cerebrovascular accident (a stroke) as a consequence of hypertensive arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease (high blood pressure).' Final appearance: Charlie Trotter spoke at a culinary conference and he flew to Wyoming to attend just three days before he was found dead . The Monday report made it clear that 'neither drugs nor alcohol contributed to his death', according to The Chicago Tribune. Another concern that came immediately after his November 5 death was that Trotter, who had closed his eponymous restaurant in 2012, would exacerbate his supposed brain aneurysm by traveling but the medical examiner has ruled that out. 'There is no scientific evidence to indicate that recent travel contributed to his death, though there was evidence of a prior stroke,' the report read. His wife Rochelle Trotter put out a statement in the days following his death, confirming that he had been cleared to fly and had permission from medical experts to attend a food conference in Wyoming just three days before he was found dead. She said that her husband learned of his brain aneurysm in January and had been taking the 'proper medication. Better days: Rochelle Trotter (left) said that her husband Charlie (right) learned about his brain aneurysm in January and had been treating it with the 'proper medication' at the time of his death . She denied the claims made in the . police report from the officers who responded to Trotter's death, saying . that they were wrong to say that he flew to Wyoming 'against medical . advice'. Mrs Trotter did not . specifically say which doctors cleared him, but did say that 'medical . experts' said it was fine for him to fly. 'The autopsy indicates the travel is not connected with his death,' she said, referring to the initial autopsy report. A sommelier who worked with Trotter and became a close friend over their years of working together said that doctors had told Trotter not to fly to avoid adding pressure to his brain. 'It was a time bomb, and he felt that he didn't have a lot of time left,' sommelier Larry Stone told The Chicago Tribune. The last picture? Trotter spoke at a culinary conference in Jackson Hole and one audience member noticed that his left hand- seen in his pocket while posing with attendee Megan Gallagher- was shaking . 'It was inoperable, and it was not something that could be repaired; it was deep inside the brain.' Mr Stone told the paper that his 54-year-old former boss had multiple seizures in the time leading up to his death. The first hints of trouble came last year when he closed his award-winning restaurant after 25 years, saying that he wanted to spend more time with his family and study philosophy. That didn't keep him from staying active, in spite of doctor's orders. Nothing . seemed particularly unusual about Trotter during the Jackson Hole conference, but . one audience member did notice that the chef's left hand was shaking . slightly as he held the microphone. Friends: Chef Anthony Bourdain (center left) and his wife Ottavia (right) hugs Trotter and his wife Rochelle Smith (center right) at a food event in Miami in February of last year . The chef's wife Rochelle was seen by neighbors screaming and crying hysterically as ambulances arrived at their home after Trotter's son Dylan found his father unconscious. 'He was much loved and words cannot describe how much he will be missed,' she said in a statement. 'His impact upon American cuisine and the culinary world at large will always be remembered.' Multi-course tasting menus that are now seen on many fine dining establishments were his handiwork, as he traded the 10-course menu at his flagship restaurant on a daily basis and boasted that frequent customers never had the same thing twice. He had a great influence on both the local and national food scene, one that many expect to be felt for years to come. Passed: Charlie Trotter's body, seen here in August 2012, was discovered by his son in their Chicago home . Wine was a passion for Trotter, and when asked at the event in Jackson Hole what he would like for his final meal, he said he wanted only the best: a bottle of 1900 Chateau Margaux, a wine that costs up to $16,000. During an interview when he decided to close his restaurant, he revealed his grand plans for what would happen to his restaurant's 26,000-strong wine cellar after it closed last year. 'I did a mathematical . calculation: If I live to the average life expectancy of the American . male — 78.9 — and I consume one bottle of wine every day, I should . consume the last bottle on my last day on this planet,' he said in an . interview with The New York Times."}

This excess carry-on is causing many passengers to lose their allocated cabin space, as well as prolonging the boarding process. In order to address the mounting concern, Jetstar will implement ‘cabin baggage officers’ in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Cairns and the Gold Coast on a trial basis. Nip in the bud: Jetstar will soon introduce 'cabin baggage officers' at airport gates in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Cairns and the Gold Coast . Any passengers who attempt to sneak extra luggage on board will be placed in 'hold in line', where baggage officers will weigh their luggage . The officers will be located at airport gates, where they will weigh and measure customer’s bags as well as arranging to have luggage checked if it looks oversized or over the assigned weight. At present, passengers who have checked in online can avoid having their bags checked by Jetstar staff until reaching the gate lounge, which is allowing those with excess carry-on to board the flight without the extra-baggage charges, reports Business Traveller. Now, passengers who attempt this will have their bags placed in the aircraft hold in line, along with the checked baggage allowance that they have purchased. Those who purchased ‘carry only fares’ will be penalised by paying the prevailing airport rates, which are higher than what is charged online. Caught red handed: Passengers found sneaking on excess luggage will pay a higher rate than what they would have if they had declared the baggage . The excess baggage being snuck on-board is causing passengers to lose their cabin-space and prolonging boarding process .

{"prompt": "(CNN) -- The European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) takes very seriously its duty of protecting endangered and vulnerable species from extinction. Our European Endangered Species Programmes (EEP) have been established to ensure a viable future for endangered animals -- including giraffes -- despite the destruction of their habitats and rampant poaching of wild animals. More than 700 giraffes are kept within our institutions to the highest possible standards of welfare and care by zoos such as Copenhagen, and EAZA monitors breeding closely to ensure that the species has the genetic diversity it needs to have the best possible chance of survival in the long term. While we understand that some members of the public are upset by the euthanization of the giraffe at Copenhagen zoo, the protection of the species as a whole must be our priority. Our resources are regrettably finite, and as a result, the EEP must prioritize animals which can contribute to the overall genetic health of the captive population. This means that in rare cases (five in the case of giraffes in EAZA zoos since records began in 1828), animals must be removed from the population by management euthanasia. Compare this to the 60 billion+ healthy, young animals killed each year worldwide for human consumption. In-breeding is a serious problem that can lead to genes being passed on that increase the population's susceptibility to disease and other chronic conditions which threaten the future of the species in our care. Zoo staff get death threats . As for alternative solutions, we cannot in good conscience recommend the transfer of animals under our protection to zoos which are not our members and therefore not subject to our strict standards of animal husbandry and welfare; transfer within our network does not represent a solution to the unsuitability of the individual animal for breeding. Contraception is difficult and in its infancy for female giraffes, and can be irreversible. Castration of a male animal can have also undesirable side-effects, and a place that could otherwise be reserved for an animal that can contribute to its species' future is lost. Release into the wild of this single individual would almost certainly result in early death for the animal, after a long and stressful journey of thousands of kilometers -- reintroduction is an intensive and complicated matter and we would not countenance this unless recommended to by the IUCN, the paramount global body for nature conservation. All of these alternatives were explored, and none were found to be viable; in addition, EAZA's position is supported by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). EAZA members do not euthanize animals lightly, and we are saddened by the death of any animal in our care. Nonetheless, we strongly support Copenhagen Zoo, which has an exemplary record of animal welfare, education, research and conservation, and which took great pains to be transparent about the situation -- 7,000 visitors came to Copenhagen Zoo on Sunday, while 15 protesters stood outside. The Copenhagen public spoke with their tickets to the zoo and left knowing far more about the real threats to conservation of giraffes in the wild. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lesley Dickie."}

Chances were at a premium as neither side could take a firm grip on proceedings and the result is a Molineux replay that only adds to an already-hectic Championship schedule.

The game’s best chance fell to Leon Clarke of Wolves, who somehow missed an open goal from eight yards out after the impressive Bakary Sako had seen a low angled drive touched onto the post by goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli. Sako, the strong and powerful Mali international, was the game’s stand-out performer and Wolves will miss him as he flies off to the Africa Cup of Nations in Equatorial Guinea. The tournament also serves as a shop window and manager Kenny Jackett is braced for interest from Premier League suitors. He said: ‘We’d love to keep him, but every transfer window there’s constant speculation on him. He’s been very consistent for me in League One and the Championship. ‘Wherever you are, your best players can be vulnerable. If we can keep him, that would be absolutely fantastic. ‘We’ve always been honest with the player about Premier League possibilities. His ambition is the Premier League but so is ours.’ Kit Symons clearly feels Fulham can go on a bit of a Cup run and fielded a strong side, while Kenny Jackett made four changes from the team that beat Brentford before the New Year. Cauley Woodrow reacts with disappointment after missing a chance during the match . Fulham striker Hugo Rodallega attempts an acrobatic effort during Saturday's third round FA Cup tie . It was a soporific start, with the sole moment of cheer in the opening 20 minutes coming when Wolves goalkeeper Carl Ikeme booted a clearance clean over the stand and into the river. Slowly, both sides started to carve out chances and the quiet crowd responded. Karl Henry picked out Clarke with a right-wing cross but the striker’s header, though firm, was directed straight at Marcus Bettinelli. After Cauley Woodrow had dispatched a shot half-way up the Putney End, Wolves broke swiftly before Bakary Sako’s daisy-cutter dribbled tamely through to Bettinelli. The best chance of the half fell to Sako just on the half-hour. The Malian strode imperiously down the left and struck a low angled shot that cracked the base of the post with the goalkeeper getting a touch. It rebounded perfectly for Clarke but he somehow missed the unguarded net from eight yards. Christensen's afternoon ended after half-an-hour when he was replaced by Sean Kavanagh . Fulham's Kostas Stafylidis (near) protects the ball under pressure from James Henry (far) Five minutes shy of half-time, the ever-willing Jack Grimmer crossed from the right and Hugo Rodallega, largely ineffective, attempted a spectacular overhead kick that narrowly cleared the bar. Sako had been Wolves’ greatest threat and, in stoppage time, he curled a set-piece over the target at the other end. The visitors started the second-half with purpose and Clarke tore to the byline to cut the ball back to Lee Evans. His powerful shot was blocked by Bettinelli at the near post. The home faithful raised their voices to try and rouse Fulham and it had the desired effect, with first Cauley Woodrow and then Seko Fofana sending shots over. Fulham striker Hugo Rodallega (right) vies for possession with Wolves' Dominic Iorfa . Iorfa climbs above Fulham striker Ross McCormack as the tie ends goalless . Midway through the second-half Henry’s header from a Matt Doherty cross was tipped over the bar by Bettinelli and the midfielder was played through shortly afterwards after Shaun Hutchinson slipped up. The defender was rescued by Bettinelli, who pushed Henry’s effort round the post. Sako looked the most likely to score by far and, after cutting inside from the left, he curled a shot that flashed past the far post with Bettinelli rooted to the turf. In the last five minutes, Fulham broke following a Wolves corner and Scott Parker flicked the ball forward to Fofana sprinting clear. He hurried his shot and Ikeme palmed it away on the edge of his box. Fulham manager Kit Symons offers encouragement to his players from the touchline . Fulham boss Kit Symons said: ‘It was a probably a typical Cup tie, lot of blood and guts, lot of endeavour but it lacked that little bit of quality, that little bit of craft and guile. ‘You can see by the team we put out today, we took it very seriously. It’s the FA Cup, it deserves to be treated with the utmost respect. ‘We knew it would be tough and hard-fought as Wolves are a big, powerful, well-organised side. I hoped we’d match that and have the quality to break them down, but some of our decision making in the final third wasn’t there today.’"}

On August 18, 2012, Barkhad was arrested by Black Hawk County Sheriff's County Office in Iowa, along with four others after cops were called to a disturbance on MM 60 near Gilberstville. A police report from the time states: 'On arrival, two subjects were holding another subject down on the ground after he had allegedly ingested a plant leave material called 'Khat' and drank a partial bottle of liquid Tylenol.

{"prompt": "By . Stephen Johns . The tradition of the long soak is dwindling as people prefer speedy cleaning to relaxation . It used to be one of the most popular ways to unwind after a busy day. But for millions the idea of slipping into a warm soothing bath is a thing of the past. Now a quarter of Britons admit they have never had a bath, according to a survey. Instead they are opting for a quick shower, often lasting just 30 seconds rather than a long soak in the tub, because of time constraints. A survey of 1,000 people across Britain found on average 26 per cent of the population never run a bath. In London and the south east, almost a third of people said that they do not splash around in a hot bath. People in the west Midlands are more likely to spend time in the bath, with 80 per cent taking regular baths. The figures appear to show that time for personal hygiene is at a premium, due to the modern pace of life. Seventeen per cent of the population spend less than 30 seconds in the shower every morning. Sharon Barclay from Homebase said: ‘An entire generation is missing out on a spectacular sensation which our grandparents took for granted. ‘Even the Romans refused to forego the extraordinary pleasure of having a bath when they came to Britain in 55 BC. ‘However, such is the pace of modern life, that a ritual which has lasted for centuries is in risk of falling out of favour in just two decades. ‘Being able to have a shower when you’re in a rush each morning is a tremendous advantage. ‘However, nothing beats being able to relax in a hot, foaming bath at the end of a long hard day.’ Young people aged between 18 and 24, were the generation most reluctant to have a bath. The trend away from having a bath was spread evenly between men and women. An average bath uses 80 litres of water but some power showers can use up to 136 litres in an eight-minute wash. In sixteenth century Britain, many towns had public baths connected to the local bakery, using the heat from ovens to warm the water. The shower is many Briton's preferred way to clean, with more than 70 per cent of people in the south east choosing it over the bath . East Anglia: 25.84 per cent . East Midlands: 28.57 per cent . London: 30.16 per cent . North East: 21.05 per cent . North West: 23.62 per cent . Northern Ireland : 34.48 per cent . Scotland: 24.72 per cent . South East : 33.56 per cent .

Credit to the young Frenchman for being able to laugh at his own expense. It took a while - 13 appearances in total - but he is finally off the mark for Arsenal. Arsene Wenger has shown huge faith in Sanogo when supporters - and even some of his team-mates - have doubted his ability. With that rod off his back, maybe he can establish himself fully at the Emirates Stadium. Yaya Sanogo scored his first goal for Arsenal during their 2-0 win against Borussia Dortmund . Sanogo mocked his poor goalscoring record on his own Twitter and Facebook social media accounts . Jack Wilshere's loss has forced Arsene Wenger into rethinking his January transfer strategy. The Arsenal manager is still prioritising the capture of at least two central defenders; a position the Gunners have been dreadfully short this season. But Wenger is also now looking to purchase a defensive central midfielder to replace Wilshere - who could be out for four months if he needs surgery on his injured left ankle. Bayer Leverkusen's Lars Bender remains Wenger's dream signing, but Sportsmail understands they are also showing an interest in Sevilla's Grzegorz Krychowiak, who could be cheaper option. Their defensive targets include Celtic's Virgil van Dijk, Manchester United's Chris Smalling and Ipswich left back Tyrone Mings. Arsene Wenger could sign a replacement for the injured Jack Wilshere during the January transfer market . Arsenal are interested in signing Manchester United defender Chris Smalling . Here's a little known fact: Borussia Dortmund defender Neven Subotic once had a 10 day trial with Crystal Palace in 2006. Iain Dowie was manager at the time of Subotic's stint at Selhurst Park. He arrived as a defensive midfielder, but his 6ft 3ins frame meant Palace viewed him as an imposing defender. Subotic, who spent part of his childhood in the USA, played for the Eagles' sister club Crystal Palace Baltimore. Palace wanted to sign the then 18-year-old, who held a US passport, but red-tape meant a deal wasn't possible after the club failed to secure him a work permit. Soon after Subotic signed for Mainz. Dortmund centre back Neven Subotic came close to joining Crystal Palace in 2006 . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain made his 100th appearance for Arsenal in Wednesday's Champions League encounter. Quite an achievement for a player still only 21-years-old. There was conjecture about just how much the England man would play this season during the summer months. He was touted as the fall-guy following Alexis Sanchez's arrival. But Chamberlain has already started 10 games for the Gunners this term.

The celebrations in the stands here that greeted news of Liverpool's failure in Istanbul were extraordinary. Didn't these two clubs used to be friends? Nevertheless, as far as Roberto Martinez was concerned, the important stuff was happening on the pitch in front of him and after an early scare his team eased past their opposition from Switzerland as easily as they had in the first leg.

There was plenty of good news here for the Everton manager. Young Boys started well, took the lead through Sekou Sanogo Junior and then struck the crossbar. Wobbly moments indeed for the home team but once Romelu Lukaku equalised from the penalty spot 10 minutes later everything changed. The Belgian scored again five minutes later - a super goal that one - before his international team-mate Kevin Mirallas raced clear on to a Darron Gibson pass to extend the lead and make sure any hopes of a comeback from Young Boys were finally extinguished. The opposition during this tie has been limited. The Swiss league is a poor one. Nevertheless, Everton do seem to be regaining a little confidence and if Martinez takes anything from Thursday night apart from an expected victory, it will be that. Lukaku was terrific until he was replaced early in the second period after feeling a twinge in his thigh. Mirallas, too, had a good night and could have scored again after half-time while young full-back Luke Garbutt impressed on the left hand side. All Martinez has to do now is make sure his team take some of this form in to the Barclays Premier League. This weekend they face Arsenal. 'I am very pleased,' said Martinez. 'The climate around the club will be good now. The domestic competition is vital to us and we know what we have to put right.' Everton began firmly on the front foot, with Lukaku causing some trouble down the right. However as soon as the Swiss team got a foothold in the game they scored. A corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty area and when Raphael Nuzzolo's shot was headed goal wards by Milan Volotic, Tim Howard did well to save. The Everton goalkeeper - not in the best of form of late - could only push the ball in to Sanogo Junior's path, though, and he prodded the ball in to the goal from six yards.

But they did and when Scott Sutter headed the next corner against the Everton bar the home team looked to be in all kinds of trouble. Another goal at that early stage and who knows what would have happened a team so low on confidence. However, minutes later Everton got the break they needed when they won a penalty. It was the decisive moment of the night. Lukaku's role in the whole affair was crucial as first he played a cute ball through to Steven Naismith and, when the goalkeeper brought the Scot down, the big Belgian beat Marco Wolfli low to his right. In an instant Everton went from looking rather shaky indeed to scoring a second goal that not only extended their aggregate lead but showcased the type of football they can play under Martinez.

By the time news of Liverpool's demise filtered though, Young Boys had all but rolled over. Mirallas could have scored when clear down the right only for the goalkeeper to save his shot down to his right. Soon after, though, he did score, running on to a Gibson through ball to beat the goalkeeper underneath his body. Mirallas was denied again by the keeper early in the second period while, with 15 minutes left, Lukaku's replacement Arouna Kone struck the post from the edge of the penalty area. Late on Everton had a goal disallowed as Leon Osman was penalised for a push. By that time Everton were perhaps more occupied by who they would be playing in the next round.

{"prompt": "Toronto, Ontario (CNN) -- The spotlight is on security -- as well as economic recovery plans -- as leaders from the world's biggest economies gather in Toronto for a pair of summits this weekend. Leaders have begun arriving for the G-8 summit, which begins Friday, followed by the G-20 summit this weekend. Security, already a major concern, was thrown into greater focus Thursday when a man with five cans of gas and an array of weapons in his car was arrested near the G-20 site, officials said. Royal Canadian Mounted Police spokesman Sgt. Marc LaPorte said the 53-year-old driver had pellet guns, a crossbow, gas tanks and chemical products in his car, and couldn't explain why those items were there. He was identified by police as Gary McCullough of Whitby, Ontario. Police said McCullough was charged with one count of possessing dangerous weapons -- an offense with a maximum sentence of 10 years. He's expected to appear in court Friday. Despite the incident's proximity to the site of the G-20 summit, there are no specific signs it's linked to the meeting, said Constable Samantha Nulle of Peel Regional Police. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, local police departments and the Canadian Military have formed an Integrated Security Unit (ISU) to deal with G-20 security, like they did earlier this year for the Olympic Winter Games in Vancouver. About 20,000 ISU personnel and security guards are providing security, with the help of fencing and cameras. G-20 countries account for 80 percent of world trade and two-thirds of the world's population. The G-8 is made up of the United States, Canada, Russia, Japan, France, the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy. When talks get under way, leaders will be hashing out economic recovery plans and some differences on how to proceed. Among the issues: how drastically to cut budget deficits, possibly risking recession, and global financial reform. The United States has been urging other countries not to pull back on stimulus plans too quickly. Britain, in contrast, has recently joined other European countries in announcing drastic budget cuts. The sessions will offer a first appearance on the world stage for British Prime Minister David Cameron and Japanese Prime  Minister Naoto Kan. Both leaders arrived in Toronto on Thursday. Other leaders are arriving Friday. In Thursday's weapons incident, Nulle said an officer pulled over a suspicious vehicle and discovered dangerous materials in the car. Police immediately sealed off the surrounding area, Nulle said. Police told CNN that another person with weapons and explosives had been taken to court Wednesday, but privacy laws prevented them from sharing more details. CNN's Jeanne Meserve and Rachel Streitfeld contributed to this report."}
{"prompt": "A new season offers players a fresh start, a chance to banish a nightmare campaign from the previous year or show the world that they are not just a flash in the pan. It’s time to rescue careers and build some others. Thibaut Courtois (Chelsea) Both Courtois and Petr Cech have a point to prove, but after all the trophies Cech has won I would say the pressure is on Courtois. He has done everything he can on loan but now he has to prove he is the present and future. One slip and Cech will be breathing down his neck. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal very happy with Phil Jones in training . Target: Chelsea keeper Thibaut Courtois has to reproduce the type of form that caught in the eye in Spain . Kyle Walker (Tottenham) Two years ago Walker was the PFA Young Player of the Year and an England regular but he has not played for his country for nearly a year. He has had injury problems but his game has not developed as quickly as he’d have liked and he needs to improve defensively. Improvements: Tottenham's Kyle Walker still has to work on his defensive play . Phil Jones (Man Utd) He arrived as the next Duncan Edwards but he has not lived up to that billing so far. It doesn’t help that his role in the team is undefined and injuries have hindered his progress, but if manager Louis van Gaal shows belief in him as a pure centre back, he can prosper. Belief: Manchester United defender Phil Jones could prosper with a run at centre back . Test: Defender Chris Smalling has failed to build on an impressive start at Manchester United . Chris Smalling (Man Utd) Similar to Jones, Smalling has not pushed on as he might have hoped. Their lack of development left England with a gaping defensive hole at the World Cup — they were not ready. But Van Gaal improved Holland’s defence and he can do the same with Smalling. Tom Ince (Hull City) A lot has been said about the young Ince but now he has to live up to the hype. His loan move to Palace didn’t really work last season but you have to admire him for turning down Inter Milan for the chance to play regularly at Hull. If he doesn’t, shine, he’ll be back in the Championship. Jack Colback (Newcastle) He was impressive at Sunderland last year but it takes a brave man to cross the Wear to Newcastle, especially on a free. Sol Campbell faced bitter abuse when he joined Arsenal from Spurs, let’s hope Jack does not suffer as much. The only way to keep people quiet is to play well. Big opportunity: Midfielder Jack Rodwell can finally fulfill his potential at Sunderland . Jack Rodwell (Sunderland) He has been considered a hot prospect for too long and now he has a chance to prove his worth. His career stalled when he left Everton for Man City, so with regular football this season he can show us his undoubted talent. He needs to lose his reputation of being injury-prone. Joe Cole (Aston Villa) His homecoming at West Ham never really went to plan, so much so his boyhood club were happy to release him in the summer. Now at Villa, he has to show he’s still got the ability that once made him one of the most exciting English midfielders of his generation. Ability: Veteran Joe Cole still has the talent to light up the Premier League . Morgan Schneiderlin (Southampton) When you spend the summer sulking because you can’t move clubs, you have to prove you are worth the hassle. Whether he stays at Southampton or gets his move to Tottenham, Schneiderlin needs to knuckle down and forget about all of this. Jack Wilshere (Arsenal) The biggest problem for Jack has been staying fit. He takes the game to the opposition and to do that you need to be in supreme condition. Because he’s so talented he’s been able to get by but after a good pre-season, now he can show that explosive pace again. Point to prove: Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere has to rediscover his explosive pace . Challenge: Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge now has to show he can lead the line without Luis Suarez . Focus: Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers must build on second place finish last season . Daniel Sturridge (Liverpool) After the season he had last time out, you might not think he has much to prove. But now he has to show he can lead the line without Luis Suarez. There’s no doubting his ability but he needs to become Liverpool’s No1 goalscorer, Mr Reliable. Brendan Rodgers (Liverpool, manager) Rodgers said last year it wasn’t just about Luis Suarez, it was about a team — now he has to prove it. He plays to win and always encourages his teams to attack. I enjoy watching his sides go forward but he needs to show last season was not a one-off. Roy Keane (Aston Villa, asst manager) It’s back to the day-to-day life of football now for Roy and it will be fascinating to see how he gets on, particularly with Paul Lambert. He’s not making decisions, so it will be a new perspective and he really needs a positive experience in club management after some failures. Upheaval: Morgan Schneiderlin must knuckle down at Southampton... or Tottenham . Big call: Tom Ince made a bold decision to snub Inter Milan and sign for Hull City . Perspective: New Aston Villa No 2 Roy Keane needs to make a positive impact . Tackle Keown ."}
{"prompt": "Oak Creek, Wisconsin (CNN) -- As community members sought emotional healing in the wake of the shooting spree at a religious service, police said Tuesday they had not identified a motive or found any telltale writings or note left by the gunman. Oak Creek Police Chief John Edwards also said family members of Wade Michael Page, 40, have not reported observing any warning signs. Page, an Army veteran who neighbors say played in a far-right punk band, was the lone gunman in the Sunday rampage at a Sikh temple, Edwards said. Page was shot to death by police responding to the attack. According to Edwards and the FBI, authorities have received tips that Page might have links to the white supremacist movement, but nothing had been confirmed. \"We may end up with just a lot of facts on what he is involved with, who he may be associated with, but we may never know that motive, because he died, and that motive died with him,\" Edwards told CNN's \"The Situation Room.\" The chief also said, counter to speculation, Page did not have a 9/11 tattoo. While the FBI has said Page never was the subject of an investigation, he was mentioned in a small number of federal law enforcement reference files in cases going back seven years, a law enforcement official told CNN on Tuesday. The official said there is no information to suggest that investigators wanted to open a case on Page, but did not have the evidence to justify it. While Page might have been sympathetic to a certain ideology, there was no evidence he had committed a federal crime prior to the Wisconsin shooting, the official said. The official did not provide details about the nature of the cases in which Page's name was mentioned. For a third consecutive night, mourners and supporters held a vigil Tuesday night to remember the six victims, pray for the wounded and grapple with grief and shock. People lit candles in an Oak Creek park and stood together in solidarity. Remembering the victims . Tales of heroism, putting others first . The Sikh American community called for a national moment of silence on Sunday. A posting on the Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund's website asked for observances at churches, mosques, synagogues and other places of worship. It said the community hopes such a gesture \"will send the message of blessings for all, and that we stand united against hate and intolerance and as part of a common humanity.\" Bernard Zapor -- the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives special agent in the investigation -- said Monday that the 9mm semiautomatic handgun with multiple ammunition magazines used by the attacker had been legally purchased. Page bought the gun on July 28 at the Shooters Shop in West Allis, Wisconsin, and picked it up two days later. The shooter bought ammunition there and used the shop's range. Shop manager Eric Grabowski and owner Kevin Nugent told CNN Tuesday that surveillance video of Page buying the gun and using it in the range two days later has been turned over to investigators. The suspect did not exhibit unusual behavior while in the store, Grabowski said. The magazine for the handgun holds at least 17 bullets. Explainer: Who are Sikhs? According to a man who described himself as Page's old Army buddy, the attacker talked about \"racial holy war\" when they served together in the 1990s. Christopher Robillard of Oregon, who said he lost contact with Page more than a decade ago, added that when Page would rant, \"it would be about mostly any non-white person.\" Page, born on Veterans Day in 1971, joined the Army in 1992 and left the service in 1998, according to Army spokesman George Wright. Page's service was marked by \"patterns of misconduct\" and he received a general discharge due to \"discreditable incidents,\" according to a Pentagon official. Robillard said Page was pushed out for showing up to formation drunk. John Tew, manager of a Harley-Davidson motorcyle store in Fayetteville, North Carolina, told CNN he fired Page from his parts coordinator job in 2004 because Page \"had a big problem with authority\" and with working with women. Tew said he found an application for the Ku Klux Klan on Page's desk the day he was dismissed. A University of Nebraska at Omaha professor told CNN's \"AC360\" on Tuesday evening that he knew Page while doing research on extremist groups about 10 years ago. Page told him he started identifying with neo-Nazis during his time in the military, Pete Simi said. The former soldier told him he believed the deck was stacked against whites, Simi said, adding he believed Page drank excessively. Two neighbors of Page identified him in photos that showed him playing in the far-right punk band \"End Apathy\" with Nazi flags hanging near him. The gunman's former stepmother spoke of a very different Wade Page she once knew before losing touch with him more than a decade ago, when she and Page's father divorced. \"It's like I don't even know that person,\" Laura Page said of more recent photos of Page. \"It is not someone I ever could possibly know or be associated with.\" She told CNN that the Page she knew was gentle and loving and had black and Hispanic friends. Sikh community continues to blend in, stand out . Sunday's attack in Oak Creek occurred 16 days after a gunman killed 12 people and wounded scores at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado. The six victims of Sunday's attack were identified by police as five men -- Sita Singh, 41; Ranjit Singh, 49; temple president Satwant Singh Kaleka, 65; Prakash Singh, 39, and Suveg Singh, 84 -- and one woman, 41-year-old Paramjit Kaur. A wake and visitation are scheduled for Friday morning. The wounded police officer, identified as 51-year-old Lt. Brian Murphy, also was in critical condition after suffering nine gunshot wounds, the police chief said, and had a \"promising,\" but long, recovery ahead. A Sikh human rights group said it would give Murphy a $10,000 reward. Sunday's attack occurred about 10:30 a.m., when temple members were reading scriptures and cooking food in preparation for the main Sunday service and community lunch. According to witnesses, the gunman started shooting in the parking lot, killing at least one person. He then entered the temple and continued firing, they said. Oak Creek Mayor Stephen Scaffidi said that he spoke with Aurora's mayor to get some advice on how to cope with the tragedy. \"He gave me some pointers and some suggestions on how to not only deal with the immediate, but how we deal with the next few weeks,\" Scaffidi said, pointing out that the Colorado town was in its third week of coping. \"We're not going to let this define us; we'll never let it define us,\" Scaffidi said. \"There are a lot of great people here, and we're not going to let this get in the way.\" Six people were killed in a shooting rampage.

Archway Sheet Metal Works, which is located next to White Hart Lane on the last patch of land Tottenham needed for their stadium development argued that the compulsory purchase order was unlawful . How Tottenham's new stadium will look for night games from 2018-19 season onwards . It is anticipated that once work starts on the new stadium it will take three years to complete. The news will give Tottenham supporters an extra lift before tomorrow's London derby against West Ham. Sam Allardyce, the West Ham manager, has stoked the flames by claiming he could have succeeded where Spurs have failed this season by getting Emmanuel Adebayor (right) scoring again. Allardyce tried to end Adebayor's nightmare at White Hart Lane by taking him to Upton Park on loan last month. Sam Allarydce has goaded Spurs fans after saying he could have got the best out of Emmanuel Adebayor . The misfiring Tottenham striker has scored just two goals in 15 games so far this season . The striker was close to a deadline day move only for Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy to veto the deal. Since then, Adebayor has not made even one of manager Mauricio Pochettino's match squads. In 12 Spurs games this year Adebayor has started just once and been on the bench three times — playing just 115 minutes. Allardyce, who has lost striker Andy Carroll for the rest of the campaign with a knee injury, instead brought in 33-year-old Brazilian Nene on a free transfer. Now Big Sam is convinced he could have got the best of Adebayor. Allardyce said: 'He is one of those players that you have to look at and say, 'How do I react to him and interact with him (because) that is the basis for how well he plays for us?' 'You use your management skills in terms of looking at his personality and talking about wanting him to enjoy his football and do what he does best: play and score goals.' West Ham striker Andy Carroll is set to miss the rest of the season with a knee injury . The Hammers have signed 33-year-old Brazilian forward Nene in an attempt to fill the void left by Carroll ."}
{"prompt": "Mario Balotelli showed how pleased he is to be back in the Italy squad after his first call-up from boss Antonio Conte by posting a smiling image with his team-mates, including some of his closest rivals for a place in the team, on Instagram. Former Juventus manager Conte left Balotelli out of the first two squads of his reign and after including him for this international window has made it clear the Liverpool striker's place at training, let alone in games, is far from safe. But Balotelli appears to be singing from the appropriate hymn book in the lead-up to the Azzurri's key Euro 2016 qualifier against Croatia in Milan on Sunday. 'Great guys! Amazing football players,' Mario Balotelli (second left) captions this image with rival Italy strikers Simone Zaza (left), Stephan El Shaarawy (second right)  along with former Milan team-mate Mattia De Sciglio . He posted a shot of himself with fellow strikers Simone Zaza (Sassuolo) and Stephan El Shaarawy (AC Milan), along with Mattia De Sciglio, another former Milan team-mate. 'Friends,' he captioned the image. 'Let's follow them! Great guys! Amazing football players.' The post is a far cry from Balotelli's cheeky jesture at the World Cup when he filled a Panini album with stickers of himself for the amusement of his Facebook followers after his goal in Italy's 2-1 win over England. After not hitting the target in the next two matches which saw Italy bow out in the group stage and Costa Rica and Uruguay progress, there was a backlash of sorts from his senior team-mates. Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli is happy to be in the Italy mix again after his first call-up by Antonio Conte . Daniele De Rossi said: 'We need real men, not Panini stickers or characters. These are of no use to the national team.' Goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon added: 'On the pitch, you see who people really are or are not.' Balotelli became a scapegoat some say after that ill-fated campaign in Brazil, but defender Giorgio Chiellini spoke in support of the talented if inconsistent forward as Italy prepared for Sunday's match and said there was no issue between Balotelli and the squad. Balotelli (centre) is with the Azzurri ahead of Sunday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Croatia . 'There is nothing to mend,' he said. 'The coach has made his choice and there is nothing to add. 'Things went badly in Brazil but we have put a lid on that. 'I understand that it is important for the media to know how many times Mario goes to the bathroom, how often he sneezes and how many times he has called his mother. Balotelli doesn't hold back  (left) and seemingly attempts to trip Ciro Immobile (right) at training in Florence . VIDEO Chiellini denies Balotelli Italy rift . 'But Balotelli is as good as De Rossi, Buffon and the newcomers. What is important is that on Sunday we will be at one.' Conte, who led Juve to three Serie A titles in a row before replacing Cesare Prandelli after the World Cup debacle, has put the ball firmly in Balotelli's court as to whether his stay with the Italy set-up is a short or long term. “If he does as I say, then good, he could be on the team or on the bench or indeed in the grandstand,' Conte said. 'If he doesn’t, well then the doors here at Coverciano (Italian team training centre) are revolving. You can come in and you can go out. We won’t be seeing you anymore and Amen.”"}
{"prompt": "Dadaab, Kenya (CNN)  -- In the middle of a famine, there is a place that houses the sickest survivors of all. Along the border between Somalia and Kenya at the International Rescue Committee hospital it is simply called a stabilization center. As a medical term, it refers to the desire to normalize vital signs, replace fluids and treat acute and deadly illness. As you might imagine, however, this place is far from stable, and instead filled with people who are starving to death -- in some cases, their bodies too far gone to even absorb the food finally made available to them. I met 6-year-old Ahmed Mohammad there. As soon as he entered Dadaab refugee camp with his father after 10 days of walking under the East African sun, it was clear his tiny prone body may have been robbed of nutrition for too long. Impact Your World: How you can help . As Dr. Humphrey Musyoka told me, \"He is half the size he should be -- a couple more weeks, and this child would've been lost.\" Musyoka knows, because over the last few months, he has seen it happen more times than he cares to remember. There is no way to dignify the description of death by starvation. It is neither quick nor painless. Not too long after the food is cut off, the body resorts to fuel reserves in the liver and fatty tissues. Once the fat is all gone, and the person is a skeleton of what he or she once was, the body searches for protein, and finds it in muscle tissue. Even the muscle of the heart is consumed, leaving someone drained and listless. The body shuts down. The pulse, the blood pressure and body temperature all precipitously drop. Little kids such as Ahmed completely stop growing and become stunted in time. The tools they use here in the stabilization center are rudimentary, and they have little choice -- but they work. A small tape measure is used to measure the child's mid-upper arm circumference or MUAC. It takes just seconds and is predictive of how much deep fat still exists in the body, a key criterion when assessing starvation. In children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years, a healthy MUAC is considered to be above 13.5 centimeters, and if it is less than 11.5 centimeters, nearly one in five die. They simply cannot be saved. Ahmed had his MUAC measured in the stabilization center -- 10.5 centimeters. Musyoka shook his head worriedly and immediately started a plan to save Ahmed. An IV was placed, and fluids were started slowly. Too much fluid could overwhelm his system. The same could be said of many foods, which may cause severe diarrhea or vomiting. Ahmed will be given Plumpy'nut, a paste that has a balance of protein, carbohydrates and fat, along with vitamins and minerals. The key is to give a lot of calories in small amounts because Ahmed's stomach is so shrunken from his malnutrition. Ahmed would have his blood drawn to check for anemia and possible bacterial infections. Musyoka said he is cautiously optimistic about Ahmed, but he carries a lot of anguish over what he has seen this summer. \"I have a 5-year-old boy at home,\" he told me as his eyes welled up. I shook his hand, looked him in the eye and said, \"Give him an extra tight hug tonight.\" He nodded and said, \"You too.\" My thoughts turned to my own three little girls, who are always in my heart. I will, doctor, I said. I will. Watch Sanjay Gupta MD Saturday and Sunday at 7:30am ET. For the latest from Sanjay Gupta MD click here."}

Every year thousands of British holidaymakers travel to the resort on the Red Sea but with the Easter holidays approaching, the government is reviewing advice to those heading to the southern Sinai region. After a tourist bus carrying 30 holidaymakers was attacked in Taba in South Sinai, close to the border with Israel in February, a team thought to include armed forces personnel was sent to investigate the vulnerability of nearby Sharm el-Sheikh. Review: A British security team was sent to the popular Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh to assess the terror threat ahead of the tourist season . The Egyptian bus driver was killed, along with three tourists from South Korea, who had been visiting Christian sites in the region, in the bombing on February 16. According to Egyptian Interior Ministry spokesman Hani Abdel-Latif, the driver and two tourists had got out of the bus to check the cargo hold but as they were re-boarding, a suicide bomber pushed through the open door into the bus and detonated his explosives. Militant Islamic group Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, Arabic for Champions of Jerusalem, which had previously only targetted police and the military, claimed responsibility for the roadside attack, saying one of its â€˜heroesâ€™ carried out the bombing. Several holiday companies stopped sending tourists to the area following the bombing, and operators Thomas Cook and Tui decided to fly German tourists home early on the advice of the government in Berlin. Assessment: The team, thought to include armed forces personnel, was sent to investigate the vulnerability of Sharm el-Sheikh after a tourist bus was attacked in Taba . The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office updated guidance given to tourists after the blast, warning against travelling . to other Red Sea resorts including Taba, Nuweiba and Dahab, and advising against taking excursions to historic sites including St Catherine's . Monastery and Petra in Jordan. It said tourists should stay within the Sharm el-Sheikh resort area, where enhanced security measures were in place, including Egyptian military check points around the resort including at the airport. The Egyptian government believes that safety concerns have now been addressed and yesterday the country's ambassador to London said the FCO restrictions did not need to be tightened, despite a number of attacks by Islamist groups protesting the overthrowing of former President Mohammed Morsi - the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood. 'We have had a team from the security . forces of Britain in the tourist areas to monitor the measures and see . what measures are in place that are satisfactory,' Ashraf Elkholy told . the Daily Telegraph.

Unrest: There have been a number of attacks by Islamist groups protesting the overthrowing of former President Mohammed Morsi (pictured) - the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood . Clash: Egyptian security forces clash with Islamist university students in Cairo . Officials from the FCO have said there would be no immediate change in travel advice for Sharm el-Sheikh, but that the situation was being monitored and the information would be updated if necessary. Elections are due to be held to elect a new president next month, after President Morsi was deposed by the Egyptian military, and protesting groups are expected to target the polls. The country's powerful former military . chief Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who led the overthrow of Islamist President . Morsi last summer, has announced his bid for office and is . widely expected to win. 'What we have to expect during . this procedure is an increase in terrorist action as they have to prove . themselves and unfortunately Egyptians and non-Egyptians will be the . targets of this,' said Mr Elkholy.

According to the statistics released by Egypt's Ahram newspaper, there has been a 24 per cent drop in European tourists visiting the country in January and February this year, when compared to 2013 figures. They contribute to an overall 28 per cent decrease in visitor numbers when visitors form other key markets, such as the Middle East and Arab countries, are taken into account. One of the biggest losses was from the Asia and Pacific markets, with 42 per cent less visitors venturing to Egypt than during the same period last year.

{"prompt": "(CNN) -- Lifetime's biopic of the late singer Aaliyah is now without a star. The network confirmed via Twitter on Sunday that Zendaya, the 17-year-old Disney actress and singer tapped to portray Aaliyah in the TV movie, has exited the project. \"We are sad Zendaya will no longer portray Aaliyah,\" Lifetime said. \"Production is currently on hold.\" It's an abrupt change for the film, as Zendaya, whose full name is Zendaya Coleman, was just announced as the biopic's lead on June 16. The young star, known for her role on Disney's \"Shake It Up!\" and Season 16 of \"Dancing With the Stars,\" didn't release an official comment on her departure but did acknowledge the casting shakeup on Twitter by quoting a source's statement to E! News. \"Aaliyah has always been an inspiration to Zendaya,\" the source told E!. \"She was honored to portray her and pay tribute to her. If she is going to do it, she wants to do it right.\" Aaliyah, born Aaliyah Dana Haughton, was killed in a 2001 plane crash at the age of 22. Her legacy as an R&B/pop singer and actress has been immense, to the point that even using her voice in a song can make fans bristle. Zendaya's casting was similarly controversial, with fans being divided over whether the burgeoning talent should take on the role. With news that she's now out of the project, some are curious if the casting criticism played a role in her departure. Yet from the beginning, the teen star made it clear that Aaliyah has been a lifelong inspiration for her, and she told MTV News on the BET Awards red carpet that she wasn't sure the biopic would do justice to her idol. \"I just felt the project wasn't 100% there,\" she told MTV, saying that the production felt \"a little rushed.\" Because \"she's someone I admire and I love so much, it can't be done halfway, or not to the standards I think it should be done at, so I just decided not to do it. \"By all means, when the right project comes along and it's done the right way, I'll be the first person ready to play Aaliyah, but this wasn't the right one for me. I've been into Aaliyah since I was little, so there wasn't too much getting into character. I always pretend I'm her anyway.\""}
{"prompt": "(CNN) -- Pakistani-American businessman Mansoor Ijaz has set off a political firestorm in Pakistan with his claims that he was brokering an offer from Pakistan's civilian leaders to the Pentagon to unseat the leadership of the Pakistani military. Those accusations forced the resignation on Tuesday of Pakistan's ambassador to the United States, Husain Haqqani, who Ijaz says orchestrated this proposal, which was delivered in a unsigned memo in May to Adm. Mike Mullen, then-U.S. chairman of the Joint Chiefs. Pakistan is a nuclear-armed state that is home to a number of Taliban groups that attack U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan and also is home to what remains of al Qaeda's \"core\" organization. Haqqani helped smooth over many tense moments in the important U.S.-Pakistan relationship, including the shooting in January of two Pakistanis by CIA contractor Raymond Davis and the Navy SEAL raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad in northern Pakistan in May. Ijaz has said that the offer to get rid of the leadership of the Pakistani Army was sanctioned by Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari. The story is an explosive one in Pakistan, where relations between the civilian government and the military leadership are often tense and the United States is deeply unpopular. Writing in the Financial Times on October 10, Ijaz explained that, \"The embarrassment of bin Laden being found on Pakistani soil had humiliated Mr. Zardari's weak civilian government to such an extent that the president feared a military takeover was imminent. He needed an American fist on his army chief's desk to end any misguided notions of a coup -- and fast.\" Haqqani denies being involved in any such scheme, and Mullen says that while he did receive a memo that made this kind of offer-- delivered to him by Obama's former National Security Adviser James L. Jones -- he ignored it because it just didn't seem credible. According to Ijaz, Lt. Gen. Ahmad Shuja Pasha, Pakistan's powerful military intelligence chief, recently traveled to London to meet with him, where he \"forensically tested\" Ijaz's evidence, which consists of Blackberry messages between Ijaz and Haqqani. While the affair has already brought down Haqqani, a longtime critic of Pakistan's military establishment and a well-known figure in diplomatic and national security circles in Washington, it could also damage the country's civilian government. Haqqani's wife, Farah Ispahani, is President Zardari's spokeswoman and a prominent member of the governing Pakistan People's Party. The man at the center of it all . Who is Mansoor Ijaz, the Pakistani-American businessman at the center of this twisted tale? Born to a family of Pakistani immigrants in Tallahassee, Florida, Ijaz grew up in rural Virginia, the son of two college teachers. After getting an undergraduate degree in nuclear physics from the University of Virginia and an MA in engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in the early 1990s Ijaz founded Crescent Investment Management, a New York investment firm. Crescent was politically well-connected. Ijaz's partner in the firm was retired Air Force Lt. General James Alan Abrahamson, who played an instrumental role in President Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative (\"Star Wars\"). Another Washington heavyweight, the former CIA director R. James Woolsey, was chairman of the board of Ijaz's publicly listed company, Crescent Technology Ventures PLC, based in London. In the mid-'90s, Ijaz gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Democratic Party, and hobnobbed with the Clintons at fund raising events. In 2003, journalist Richard Miniter, in a book titled \"Losing Bin Laden: How Bill Clinton's Failures Unleashed Global Terror\", relied on Ijaz as the principal source for the key part of his thesis, which concerned the five years Osama bin Laden spent in Sudan in the early and mid- 1990s. Miniter described multiple attempts Ijaz made between August 1996 and 1998 to interest the Clinton administration in improving relations with Sudan, as well as Sudanese offers to hand over intelligence on al Qaeda. In his account to Miniter and in later writings, Ijaz claimed to have helped draft a proposal for Sudan to provide intelligence on al Qaeda to the Clinton administration, and that Sudan had offered to arrest bin Laden. Clinton administration officials did not take Ijaz up on any of his offers to help because they viewed him as \"a Walter Mitty living out a personal fantasy,\" according to Miniter. And the 9/11 Commission, which interviewed Ijaz, concluded that were was no \"credible evidence\" that the Sudanese had made any offer to hand over bin Laden. In a 2004 interview with Fox News about Iraq, Ijaz, in his then-capacity as a foreign affairs analyst for the network, made another sensational claim: Chemical warheads were being smuggled into Iraq for a potentially catastrophic attack against American troops. And to top it off, Ijaz strongly suggested that the whole plan was given the green light by hardline Iranian mullahs. The story had everything to attract attention -- Mad mullahs! WMD on the loose in Iraq! (At last!) And the threat of thousands of potential American casualties. Ijaz now concedes, \"This was an erroneous report based on information I had received from a former intelligence official on the ground in Iraq. I did not second source this story.\" Ijaz also told CNN, \"I have written over 170 op-ed columns, appeared over 200 times on television and have not once had a word of what I said retracted due to factual errors.\" (Ijaz has written one op-ed for CNN.com). Ijaz told Fox in 2003 that \"eyewitness sources\" placed Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, in Iran. Asked by host Brit Hume about the sourcing of the story, Ijaz responded, \"I can just tell you that the source is unimpeachable. It is from inside Iran. These are eyewitness accounts.\" There was, of course, nothing to this story. Ijaz now says, \"At the time I made it, I believed the source who had given the data to me.\" Described as a \"U.S. nuclear proliferation and terrorism expert,\" Ijaz told the Gulf News newspaper in 2006 that Iran not only had a nuclear bomb, it was seeking to \"duplicate them in large numbers before revealing their existence to the world.\" Five years later, Iran still does not have a nuclear weapon, but Ijaz asserted to CNN, \"They had in my view then, and it remains my view now, at least one nuclear weapon stored in component parts.\" In August 2003 Ijaz told the British newspaper The Guardian that he had learned that the Bush administration had brokered a deal with Pakistan's dictator, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, not to capture or kill bin Laden so as not to cause unrest in the Muslim world. Ijaz told The Guardian \"There was a judgment made that it would be more destabilizing in the longer term (if bin Laden were captured or killed). There would still be the ability to get (bin Laden) at a later date when it was more appropriate.\" Ijaz provided no evidence for this claim, and the idea that the Bush administration would do a deal to let bin Laden go free is ludicrous on its face. Ijaz told CNN \"I stand by my comments, taken in full context, throughout that article.\" Peeling back the layers of the story . Pakistan's government and Pakistani and American journalists continue to look into story behind \"Memogate.\" What is puzzling about all of this -- if the allegations are true that Ambassador Haqqani used Ijaz to propose a deal to remove Pakistan's military leaders to Mullen -- is: Why would Haqqani use Ijaz to do this? After all, Haqqani has many formal and informal contacts at the Pentagon, and Ijaz has a history of making sometimes exaggerated or erroneous claims, and his record as an unsuccessful freelance diplomat with Sudan in the 1990s is a matter of public record. Finally, if Haqqani was looking for a discreet back channel to the Pentagon, Ijaz turned out not to be the ideal messenger as he was the person who outed the whole affair in the pages of the Financial Times last month. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peter Bergen and Andrew Lebovich."}
{"prompt": "The struggle for democracy is not dead, say Hong Kong's pro-democracy activists, who have pledged to continue opposing Beijing despite setbacks. The activist group Occupy Central had hoped that their threats of a mass sit-in in Hong Kong's downtown Central district would convince China to approve open democratic elections for Hong Kong's next leader. But on Sunday, the Chinese government said the elections should only consist of candidates approved by a Beijing-backed committee, dealing a blow to democracy supporters. Even the leader of the movement seemed deflated. \"Up to this point, we failed,\" Benny Tai, the co-founder of Occupy Central, told Bloomberg Tuesday. \"Beijing refused to back down.\" But Chan Kin-man, a fellow co-founder, told CNN on Wednesday that Tai's remarks did not mean surrender. \"We may not have attained that specific goal,\" he said, referring to the hoped-for reforms. \"But we want to create a resistant movement in Hong Kong. As long as the democratic spirit continues in Hong Kong, we will not give up.\" 'We will occupy Central' Chan said Occupy will proceed with its mass sit-in \"soon,\" bringing downtown Hong Kong to a halt. It's the culmination of years of pent-up unhappiness. When Hong Kong, a former colony of the United Kingdom, was returned to Chinese rule in 1997, the two countries struck an agreement promising Hong Kong the democratic election of its own leader, known as the chief executive. But the democratic reforms have not materialized. Seventeen years after the handover, the city's chief executive is chosen by a committee filled with Beijing loyalists, leading to frustration among pro-democracy Hong Kongers who want the city's leader to be chosen by local people, not China. That's why many of them see China's recent proposal as a bitter sham. The National People's Congress (NPC) proposed Sunday the Hong Kong public be given the right to vote for its next leader — but only on up to three candidates approved by a Beijing-backed committee. Democracy's activists' chosen response, civil disobedience, is similarly controversial. Chinese officials have repeatedly said occupying Central would be an illegal act that would jeopardize Hong Kong's economic security. Hong Kong's own security chief has warned the protest could turn violent, and \"things could get out of control.\" In August, an \"anti-Occupy\" march organized by pro-government activists drew tens of thousands. \"We want universal suffrage, but not at any cost,\" said its organizer Robert Chow. 'Ungovernable' Hong Kong streets aren't the only thing that'll be paralyzed. A group of 26 pro-democracy legislators has said they will vote down any undemocratic proposal. Without their votes, Beijing's reform proposal will not have the necessary votes to become Hong Kong law, resulting in gridlock. \"We are going to veto it to show our determination that we are not going to accept this fake democracy,\" said Albert Ho, a pro-democracy legislator who is involved with Occupy Central. Li Fei, China's deputy secretary-general of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, has said Hong Kongers only have themselves to blame for lack of reform if they veto Beijing's proposal. This has effectively set up a standoff between Hong Kong and Beijing. Alan Leong, another pro-democracy legislator, said Hong Kong is becoming \"ungovernable.\" Without a popular mandate, the next chief executive will face serious challenges as he or she tries to control an increasingly upset civil society. \"There will be a new age of civil disobedience and non-cooperation across the board,\" Leong told CNN. But, he added, Hong Kong spiraling into chaos may also persuade Chinese leaders that robust democratic reforms are what's needed to regain stability. \"It's like a phoenix rebirth sort of thing. We're getting worse in order to get better.\" International support . In recent days, Western governments have spoken up in defense of Hong Kong's democracy activists. British lawmakers have announced plans to visit Hong Kong to conduct an inquiry into whether its handover treaty is being violated by China's actions. But China's National People's Congress has responded angrily, calling the inquiry a \"highly inappropriate act which constitutes interference in China's internal affairs.\" In the United States, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the U.S. government \"supports universal suffrage in Hong Kong in accordance with the Basic Law and the aspirations of the Hong Kong people.\" \"We believe that an open society with the highest possible degree of autonomy and governed by rule of law is essential for Hong Kong's stability and prosperity.\" But Hong Kong's democracy activists doubt the United States or United Kingdom can make a big difference. \"I do not have much hope on these two governments in particular,\" said Ho. \"Of course they should say something, if they still have the moral fiber to stand up to the strong economic pressure of China. They should know what is right and what is wrong... if they have the guts to do it.\" Ho said he and other legislators are currently requesting an \"urgent appeal\" with the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations and the Human Rights Committee on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to examine whether the rights of Hong Kongers are being violated.

{"prompt": "A British court sentenced a 35-year-old woman Thursday to more than five years in prison for using Facebook to promote terrorism -- including urging other women to send their husbands off \"to fight for the sake of Allah\" and saying she looked forward to the day her young son could join them. Runa Khan was arrested in her hometown of Luton, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of London, last December, and she pleaded guilty to four counts of distributing terrorist publications more than seven months later. Her sentencing occurred Thursday in Kingston Crown Court, the Metropolitan Police Service said. The four counts relate to four different specific Facebook posts posted by Khan, under the name Khawla Khattab, according to police. One, from late July 2013, shows a suicide vest with the words \"sacrificing your life to benefit Islam.\" Another gives details to another person online about how to go from Turkey to Syria -- a common route for would-be jihadists looking to join groups like ISIS, the Islamist extremist group that has used brutal tactics against nonbelievers while taking vast swaths of Syria and Iraq. In a message posted September 18, 2013, Khan speaks directly to her fellow women. \"Dear sisters,\" she writes, \"if you love your sons, your husbands and your brothers, prove it by sending them to fight for the sake of Allah. \"Don't you want them to enter jannah\" -- an Islamic concept of eternal paradise -- \"without reckoning?\" Khan adds. \"Don't you want them to prepare for you a palace in jannah?\" On that same day, Khan reposted an article headlined \"Sisters' role in jihad off the battlefield\" that suggests that mothers introduce very young children to target shooting as a way of training them for jihad. \"There are two main reasons why sisters themselves also need to get military training,\" the article adds. \"Firstly, so they can participate in jihad themselves. And secondly, so they can train their sons and daughters for it.\" Detectives also uncovered other Facebook postings, like one complaining about Muslims who condemned the 2013 murder of British soldier Lee Rigby near a barracks in southeast London. Cellphone footage from right after the attack shows one of the now-convicted murderers, Michael Adebolajo, ranting that the killing was \"an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth\" for British soldiers' killing of Muslims overseas. And in late September 2013, Khan posted a comment on Facebook that said, \"Zipping up my 8 year old boys jacket as he wants to play outside for a bit. I pictured the future while I was zipping up his jacket, inshallah\" -- which translates to \"if God is willing\" -- \"I'll be tying the shahada bandana round his forehead and hand him his rifle and send him out to play the big boys game. Allahu Akbar.\" Cmdr. Richard Walton, the head of the Metropolitan Police's counterterrorism command, said in a statement that Khan used social media to \"spread extremism, radicalise others and justify children being used for terrorism.\" Her case is one of many related to terrorism that British authorities have pursued in recent years. \"We aim to make the internet a more hostile environment for terrorists,\" Walton added. \"Today's sentence supports that aim.\""}

The media have invaded her privacy and turned her into a carnival attraction, she told Oprah Winfrey on Tuesday. But Suleman also acknowledges that the media has also become a source of income for her, a single mother of 14 children. \"That [Star magazine] photo shoot was $100,000,\" Suleman said on Winfrey's show via satellite from California, referring to the January cover that depicted her \"bikini body.\" \"I was ashamed of that -- that's not my character -- but I felt as though I needed to do something,\" she said. \"I did it because there were 14 hungry mouths. I own full responsibility for providing for my children. We have some of that money left until I figure out another way to make ends meet.\" At this point, with eight 14-month old babies and six other children between the ages of 3 and 8, one of whom has autism, Suleman doesn't appear to have the time to take up a full-time job. She does have three nannies who help her during the day in shifts. But even so, Suleman says she is constantly counting heads, making bottles or keeping a child from hurting another, as was revealed when Winfrey's camera crew spent 24 hours in her home. \"You're so busy trying to keep up, you don't have time to think, reflect or feel anything,\" she told Winfrey. \"You can't regret children, but [my] choices were childish, immature and selfish. I wasn't thinking at that time.\" At the start of the interview, Winfrey made it clear that Harpo Productions, her multimedia company, didn't pay Suleman \"a dime\" and, in fact, Suleman approached Winfrey to tell her side of the story. \"Everything that [the media] have said so far about me, and about me wanting to do this on purpose -- I never wanted to use children for fame,\" Suleman said, adding that her rationale for implanting eight embryos at one time stemmed from a variety of factors. There was what she calls \"a childish desire to have a large family,\" and \"perhaps selfishness, trying to compensate for being an only child, trying to fill some missing piece inside,\" she said. \"I believe I've always coveted that connection, that attachment to another human being, and it felt safer with children than a significant other,\" Suleman added. Suleman emphasized repeatedly to Winfrey that she's determined to take care of her brood on her own, without government assistance and without turning to adoption or foster care. \"I will do everything as a mother to avoid that at all costs,\" she told Winfrey, although she said she would never consider a reality TV show, which she considers exploitative and borderline abusive, or doing porn, despite having received three offers since the birth of her octuplets. Yet Suleman did appear in a two-hour Fox special that documented the first six months of her octuplets' lives and aired on the network in August 2009. Around that time, there were reports that Suleman had signed on to do a reality show with U.K. production company Eyeworks. However, Suleman said that she \"would never do a reality show, that's been a lie from the beginning.\" She told Winfrey that she has \"been ashamed of myself to go through certain media outlets to provide for my children,\" before adding, \"this was my choice and my responsibility, and I didn't want to depend on anyone.\" As a result, Suleman said she lives \"every single day, every hour of the day, with a tremendous amount of guilt. I feel guilty when I look at the older ones, they all have different unique needs,\" she told Winfrey. \"I feel guilty when I'm holding one or two and I can't be there for the others when they're crying.\" Regardless of the way she markets her \"Octomom\" identity, Suleman said the biggest misconception people have about her is that she did it all for fame. \"I'm not a celebrity. I'm a pseudo-celebrity catapulted into this media mess,\" she said. \"Was I in denial thinking it wouldn't happen? Yeah. Did I want it? No.\""}
{"prompt": "Liverpool fans will have the perfect opportunity on Thursday night to see if World Cup teenager Divock Origi really is the answer to all their problems at Anfield. With Luis Suarez gone, Daniel Sturridge injured and Mario Balotelli struggling badly, it is ironic that their £10million striker Origi will be in action against Everton in the Europa League for his loan club Lille. A goal or two will undoubtedly lead to calls from the Kop that he is brought back from France straight away to ease the Reds out of a mini-crisis following an embarrassing 3-0 home defeat against Real Madrid. VIDEO: Scroll down to see Liverpool loan star Divock Origi firing the goals in for Lille . Belgium international Divock Origi signed for Brendan Rodgers' men in June after an impressive World Cup . Origi celebrates scoring Lille's opening goal against Wolfsburg in his side's Champions League clash . Origi (left) in action for Belgium against Bosnia's Senad Lulic during the 1-1 draw between the sides in October . Brendan Rodgers swooped for the 19-year-old after he starred for Belgium last summer but agreed to immediately send him back to Lille on a season-long loan to aid his development. Officially, that is still written in stone though when a club as powerful as Liverpool are paying out millions of pounds, they usually find a way if they wanted Origi back earlier, possibly in January. Former Anfield striker Michael Owen thinks they should but Everton manager Roberto Martinez, whose side have the task of stopping Origi tonight, advises caution about rushing the 19-year-old into the Premier League. Origi celebrates with Chelsea star Eden Hazard after he opened the scoring against Russia at the World Cup . Roberto Martinez's Everton will look to limit Origi's influence for Lille in their Europa League meeting . 'You need to think about what the best step is to get a player ready for the Premier League. Sometimes as a young player you need to play games and you need to play minutes,' said the Everton boss. 'Remember that Origi didn't have many starts last season. He was more coming on as substitute, and slowly in the second half of the season he had a bigger role. So maybe he needed more starts before coming over. That is a strategy that has been put in place. 'I don't know the details surrounding the loan, but for me it's not strange.' Origi (left) shields the ball from Mile Jedinak during Belgium's friendly against Australia in September . Origi will come up against Tim Howard for the first time since the keeper's heroics against Belgium in Brazil . You can see Martinez's point of view. Liverpool's current predicament is borne out a perfect storm of losing Sturridge for two months with thigh and calf injures and the disastrous form of Balotelli and another summer signing Rickie Lambert. That doesn't mean Origi is the answer either at this moment. He had an explosive World Cup where his pace and movement shocked defenders. But towards the end of the tournament he was less effective, and has spoken himself of missing seven or eight chances against Tim Howard when Belgium played USA. Howard of course will be in Everton's goal against him tonight. This season, Origi has scored five goals to underline his potential, four for Lille and once for his country. And yet his overall form has blown hot and cold. He is inconsistent – something Liverpool don't need. Having said all that, if Origi does well against Everton, it may look odd to keep him in France while his parent club are struggling in front of goal. Martinez, who has an encyclopedic knowledge of world football and was in Brazil as a television summariser last summer, knows Origi's qualities. 'The World Cup showed he is intelligent and has a real strong personality. He has got real pace and power, a striker that can play really well in wide areas and a real threat on the counter attack. 'When he faces space he can be really dangerous. Origi can finish with both feet but is probably more right footed. I think he is someone that needs to be facing the space to be at his very best.' Liverpool fans don't have to take Martinez's words for it. They will be able to see Origi with their own eyes against their Merseyside rivals and whatever happens it's unlikely he'll be swapping shirts with an Everton player at half-time."}

Smashed: The property is held up by scaffolding and the brick wall show the impact of the lorry . A recluse weighing 35-stone was forced to abandon his home yesterday after a council lorry smashed into it - leaving his house for the first time in years. Mark Dawson, was named by his neighbours who said they have never seen leaving his home with the only activity outside the cottage being supermarket and takeaway deliveries to his door. Mr Dawson was forced to abandon his cottage in Bishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire, on Tuesday after a council cleaning truck reversed into it smashing the front window and door. Firefighters were called to secure the scene at 12.30pm and brought Mr Dawson out through the back. Friends said they believed Mark, who neighbours estimate weighs 35-stone had either been rehoused, or was staying with relatives. One neighbour, who lives three doors from the damaged house, said: ‘I have never seen him. I have lived here for three years and I have never seen him leave. ‘He even has his shopping delivered from supermarkets so he didn’t have to go anywhere. ‘He would probably never have left if it wasn’t for the council lorry.’ Another neighbour, who witnessed the incident, said: ‘The truck was parked up across the street, the driver had got out to go to the toilet and forgotten to put the hand break on. ‘Next thing you know, the bin lorry starts rolling towards our row. I heard a loud thud and came out to have a look at the damage.' The neighbour said that Mr Dawson rarely leaved the house and was now likely to be staying with family until his house was safe. Another eye witnesses said Mr Dawson seemed very distressed about leaving his home. Recluse: Mr Dawson is said to rarely leave home and has all food delivered to the door. It may therefore be the first time in years he has been outside his Hertfordshire property . An ambulance was called to collect the stunned resident and the property was boarded up earlier today with scaffolding appearing to hold up the front wall. The East Hertfordshire District Council vehicle rolled from the cemetery across a roundabout into the terraced cottage in Bishop’s Stortford, on Tuesday morning. The driver, who had pulled up to use the public toilets at the cemetery, told police the handbrake had failed. Mr Dawson, who was unhurt, was reassured by an officer while police climbed over the back garden wall using a ladder to access the property. Fire and rescue crews cordoned off the area and used props and boards to stabilise the front of the cottage and the neighbouring property in preparation for the truck to be recovered. A structural engineer arrived on the scene at about midday to assess the damage’ Hertfordshire Fire and Rescue Service Incident commander Dean Risley said: ‘The porch is only staying up because it’s sitting on the roof of the vehicle. ‘The chances are it will probably come down but we’re hoping it might not. ‘It will have to come down eventually anyway because it’s unsafe.’ East Herts District Council confirmed today that they are investigating the situation."}

The number of drink drivers caught behind the wheel by police has soared in the last two years - with officers catching one boozy motorist who was just 14. The youth was among almost a dozen underage drivers suspected of drinking and driving over the past two years, along with eight 16-year-olds and two teens aged 15. Figures released under the Freedom of Information Act revealed the 14-year-old boy was stopped in 2010 by West Midlands Police. Meanwhile the oldest driver who faced prosecution for being under the influence of alcohol was 85. The force charged 3,094 people with drink-driving last year - 409 more than the 2010 figure of 2,685. The figures emerged after the force recorded a 19 per cent jump in the number of people failing breath tests during a month-long summer crackdown. Inspector Greg Jennings, who led the campaign, said: 'Drivers are putting themselves at risk of losing their licence, large fines and imprisonment as well as the guilt and shame of ruining the lives of others. 'The only safe level of alcohol to drive with is zero. 'Drinking any alcohol consumption will impair your ability to drive.' Police say there has been a worrying rise in the amount of underage drink drivers who are getting behind the wheel when they have had too much to drink (posed by models) Road safety campaigners said they were 'deeply concerned' at the rise in young drink drivers. Alice Granville, of the Institute of Advanced Motorists, said: 'It’s deeply concerning that there have been a number of recent drink-drive incidents involving minors in the West Midlands. 'Underage offenders need to be educated on the effects of drink driving and the dangers of being reckless behind the wheel.' Britain’s youngest drink driver was caught in 2005 in Thatcham, Berkshire, when police pulled over a swerving Vauxhall Corsa on Christmas day to find a 12-year-old girl at the wheel. Earlier this week it was revealed that businessman Arthur Kibble was selling controversial pills which claimed to help drivers beat police breath tests. He was condemned for marketing what safety campaigners called the 'dangerous and stupid' Alcopal tablets."}

{"prompt": "(CNN) -- U.S. presidents should not be sworn into office with their hand on a Bible. At Monday's inauguration of his second term, President Barack Obama will raise his right hand and place his left on not one, but two Bibles: One owned by Abraham Lincoln and the other by Martin Luther King Jr. The Constitution requires he give this oath of office: \"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.\" You might recall that at his 2009 inauguration, President-elect Obama and Chief Justice John Roberts played some kind of \"mad libs\" with this oath during the swearing-in ceremony, muddling it so badly that they had to redo it a few days later.\rBut why does the president swear on a Bible? Why doesn't he place his hand on the U.S. Constitution -- the very document he's promising to \"preserve, protect and defend\"? Opinion: Learning from Lincoln, Wilson, FDR . The Constitution does not require that the president take the oath of office by swearing on a Bible. That would have been a very simple requirement for the constitutional drafters to include. To the contrary, the Founders wanted to ensure that Americans of any faith -- or no faith -- could hold federal office. They set it forth plainly in Article VI: \"... No religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.\" Placing a hand on a Bible while reciting the presidential oath is simply a tradition started by George Washington. Indeed, two presidents, Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams, did not use a Bible at their swearing-in ceremonies. Although Roosevelt's reasons are unclear, John Quincy Adams' reasons could not be more plain. Adams, the son of President John Adams, was a religious man. But he chose to be sworn in with his hand on a book of U.S. laws. He wanted to demonstrate that he recognized a barrier between church and state and that his loyalty was to our nation's laws above all else. Adams also refused to campaign for the presidency because he believed it was beneath the dignity of the office to make promises that might not be kept. Clearly, Adams was not a man who acted because of tradition alone. He had to truly believe in what he did. Opinion: Why 'Hail to the Chief' remains unsung . Some will argue that swearing on the Bible ensures the president adheres to his oath. But let's be honest: We have seen presidents and other elected officials swear to uphold the laws of our country with their hands on a Bible and go on to break many laws and ethical rules. It comes down to the person's moral code, not a 30-second oath. And just so it's clear, my objection is not only to the Bible. I would hold the identical view if it were the Quran, the Book of Mormon or any other religious scripture. The Founding Fathers made it clear that the U.S. Constitution, \"...shall be the supreme law of the land.\" It is the living legacy they bestowed upon us. It is the framework for our government. And as such, that's the document our president should place his hand on. It should be clear to all that the president views the Constitution as our nation's genesis.

{"prompt": "(CNN) -- There has been much speculation about whether the ads that President Barack Obama's campaign and its supporters have been running that are critical of Mitt Romney's tenure at Bain Capital will be effective. There is also lots of critiquing of the reasons and effectiveness of first lady Michelle Obama's appearances on talk shows and reality shows (\"The Biggest Loser,\" \"Late Show With David Letterman,\" \"The Daily Show,\" etc.). But something I saw last night indicates the Bain ads are starting to have an effect, and that women view Michelle Obama as a positive -- a conduit to the president. I was invited to sit in remotely on two focus groups of so-called \"Wal-Mart\" moms in Richmond, Virginia, and Las Vegas. Both groups -- 23 women, in all -- were screened to ensure the moms were not strong partisans on either side, and most identified themselves as independents and undecided. The Las Vegas group was all Latinas. It was a fascinating exercise that confirmed just how tight the presidential campaign will be. But what struck me most was that while Mitt Romney is still largely an unknown with these women -- and as such still has room and opportunity to define himself -- many of them said they did not like what they had heard described from ads about his time as head of Bain Capital. They gave him kudos for being a businessman, saying that would be a good attribute for a president in creating jobs, but they also underscored what they had heard in the ads that had been running in their hometowns. They used phrases like \"I heard that while he was the head of a company, many workers lost their jobs ...\" \"That scares me.\" When asked to use one word or phrase to describe Romney, the words or phrases they used included \"Don't know that much about him,\" \"selfish, \"businessman who is concerned with making himself some money,\" \"concerned about the wealthy,\" \"can't be trusted,\" \"scares me,\" and \"lackluster\" -- again, echoing some of what is being said in the Bain ads around the country. They did admire him for being a \"good family man,\" and some of the women appreciated his corporate success but others followed up with \"the country is more than a business ... a country has to take care of its people.\" Sound familiar? Some also gave him credit for having passed a health care plan in Massachusetts, one he is now running away from on the campaign trail. Opinion: 'Anti-business' label could hurt Obama's chances . So while in the minds of many of these women, Mitt Romney is largely undefined, what they apparently do know and feel about him seems to echo those Bain ads -- and look to represent a beginning sketch of someone they cannot trust. To be clear, these women were not in the tank for Obama -- but that was the whole point for the exercise to begin with. Many have been disappointed with his \"lack of keeping his promises,\" and many said they haven't seen the change that he talked about so much in 2008. When asked to use a word or phrase to describe Obama, they used \"false promises,\" \"not a lot of change,\" \"big government.\" But by and large, the women in both of these groups would then follow up with phrases or explanations that would seem to indicate they understood just how difficult a situation he was handed when he came into office. Many stated \"he can't do it in three years,\" or \"he has been productive but he is hitting walls,\" and \"he came into a big mess and has made some improvements.\" It seemed very fertile ground for the Obama campaign to make the FDR argument also used by President George W. Bush 2004, the one about not changing horses midstream. Based on their words, these women were most concerned about the economy, jobs and housing. And again, words associated with Romney, such as \"concerned for the wealthy,\" seemed to indicate a disconnect with what families were struggling with. Interestingly, neither group had any idea what the \"gender gap\" was. But as they were led in a conversation about issues important to women -- which were inextricably linked to the economy and concern for the health and future of their children -- women in both groups volunteered that Michelle Obama was someone to further the interests of women and their families. The president \"listens to Michelle,\" they said. Some in the Latina mom group went further and said that Michelle Obama's interests are their interests because she is a woman and a minority. And because of this, the president would make sure their interests are represented. In their eyes, she was them. There is no doubt there are opportunities here for Romney to work on filling in the blanks, because there are many. But if the old adage is right, that in politics you need to define yourself before your opponent does, then the Romney campaign will need to more fully explain his time at Bain, including why he made millions even as he fired workers and closed companies, denying workers their health care and pensions. Because right now, what has the potential to sink in is an image of Mitt Romney as head of Bain Capital. That, at least with this small sliver of moms in key battleground states, is one that scares them. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Maria Cardona ."}

Off track: Rosberg lost the lead of the race to Lewis Hamilton on lap 29 after his error at Turn One . ‘I felt a bit awkward when they were booing Nico,’ said Hamilton in the wake of his victory in Monza which sees him close the gap to Rosberg to 22 points in the drivers’ standings. ‘I don't like that in sport. After the race and when we get out of the car everyone should be nice to each other.’ Despite the strains of their title battle, which flared up last month in Spa after Hamilton and Rosberg collided on the second lap, the 29-year-old Briton insists he remains on friendly terms with his team-mate. Straight on: Rosberg was forced to take to the escape road after his costly error . Asked if they were friends again by Alesi, Hamilton replied: ‘Of course. We're team-mates, always will be.’ Hamilton’s latest remarks are in stark contrast to his comments after the Monaco Grand Prix in May in which he said he and Rosberg were 'not friends' but 'colleagues'.

It’s no surprise, then, that its universe is expanding. Although this XCOM spin-off has been in development since 2006, numerous facelifts have transformed what was once a first-person shooter into a third-person adventure. But thankfully, The Bureau: XCOM Declassified promises to retain the tactical element fans have come to expect from the series. Changed for the better: Although reaction was mixed when 2K Marin first unveiled the game, transforming it into a third-person shooter seems like a sensible move . Developed by 2K Marin, the team behind Bioshock 2, Declassified is set in 1962 at the height of the Cold War. Originally established as America’s covert defense against the Soviet Union, The Bureau must adapt and overcome a threat unlike anything the world has faced before. As special agent William Carter, players will call the shots and pull the trigger, leading their squad of agents in the high-stakes secret war for humanity’s survival. Paramount to repelling the outside threat is The Bureau’s ability to cover-up the enemy’s existence in order to prevent worldwide panic. Similar to the previous game, your decisions have a serious impact on the overall result. Every command can mean the difference between life and death for Carter, his squad and mankind. Carter can also use a unique Battle Focus ability – although exact details about how this works have not been revealed. It has also been reported that Declassifed is a single player experience, and will not feature any sort of multiplayer. ‘We’re thrilled about 2K Marin’s refined vision for The Bureau: XCOM Declassified,' said Christoph Hartmann, president of 2K. 'The game has evolved through a creative and iterative development process, and the result is a narrative-driven experience that is smart, engaging, and challenges players to think tactically.' Watch this space: There is still no word yet on whether Declassified will be coming to next-gen consoles . He added: ‘The team has been working hard to leverage core XCOM elements like tactical decision-making and permanent death of squad mates in a purposeful way that makes this a unique tactical shooter. ‘To that end, The Bureau will challenge players unlike any other third-person tactical shooter.’ It's set for release on August 20 in North America and August 23 internationally.

For the green room, Clinton's representatives requested: 'Coffee, tea, room temp sparkling and still water, diet ginger ale, crudité, hummus and sliced fruit.' The university had to buy a a computer, mouse and printer, as well as a scanner,for her visit. The emails reveal university officials debating the style and color of the  armchairs for Clinton and moderator at her Luskin Lecture for Thought Leadership speech on March 5, 2014 as well as the pillows. Her representatives requested two long, rectangular pillows be put on the chairs. Clinton says all of the money she receives from speaking engagements goes towards her family's charity, the Clinton Global Initiative . The exchanges also reveal five days before the lecture Clinton’s team rejected the podium planned for her use and had to get an new one and rent a new university seal to match and that the award she was to be presented with should be in a box - not draped around her neck. The university asked whether there was a reduced rate for public universities to which they were told $300,000 is the 'special university rate.' The likely 2016 presidential candidate fees have been well-documented. Earlier thus year she defended the nearly quarter-million dollar fee she charges for speaking engagements at colleges and universities after students at one university demanded that she return the fee. Clinton said that the enormous sums of money she has collected for speeches have gone towards her family's charity, The Clinton Foundation. Clinton's wealth has been under scrutiny since an interview earlier this year in which she described her family as 'dead broke' and in debt when husband Bill Clinton left the White House in January 2001. Combined, Bill and Hillary Clinton have a net worth of more than $100 million . The potential 2016 presidential candidate later called that description 'inartful.' 'All of the fees have been donated to the Clinton Foundation for it to continue its life-changing and life-saving work. So it goes from a foundation at a university to another foundation,' Clinton said during an interview with ABC News when asked about the criticism she and her husband have faced recently for their wealth. Clinton defended her fee by saying that her speaking engagements are used to present 'new ideas to help strengthen the economy, which in turn, will help lower income inequality.' 'It’s been my experience,' Clinton said, 'That they’re not worried about my speaking or my household, they’re worried about their own. And that’s the kind of debate I think I’m furthering as I go around the country speaking.'"}

Some Armed Forces reservists in Afghanistan are being paid six-figure salaries by the Government, it emerged last night. Military rules state that if reservists’ pay works out less than they would earn in their civilian job, they can claim for extra cash, known as a Reservist Award. So if a reservist works in the City, for example, the gap to be made up between the military pay and their civilian salary can be substantial. Well paid: Some reservists members of the Armed Forces are being paid six-figure salaries because of rules that mean that if they earn less while serving, they can claim for extra cash (file picture) Figures released under the Freedom of Information Act reveal that this year, eight reservists called up for duty were paid more than £100,000 for their tour. One of these so-called ‘City soldiers’ was paid £135,000 – several times the pay of regular soldiers – despite only holding the rank of a junior officer. Many of those paid six-figure salaries are understood to be members of the TA unit based in the City of London, the Honourable Artillery Company. Others included members of the Royal Marine Reserve and the RAF Reserve. The Reservist Award is intended to prevent those called up losing out financially because of their service – but some ministers believe the payments cannot be justified and the pay rules are currently under review. An MoD source told The Daily Telegraph: ‘There will have to be a tightening up of the system to limit these costs. It doesn’t make sense to be mobilising junior soldiers on over £100,000 with the Government picking up the bill for their City salary.’ Several doctors and surgeons from the Army medical reserve were also paid more than £100,000 for tours in Afghanistan, with one paid £225,000. Reservist pay rules are being reviewed as the MoD attempts to almost double the number of deployable reservists to 30,000. An MoD spokesman said there was a ‘strict upper limit’ to the Reservist Award, adding: ‘A significant proportion of those in receipt of a large award will be medical experts who deliver world-class care to injured troops on the battlefield.’"}
{"prompt": "(CNN) -- A new CNN poll confirms that we're witnessing a quiet reversal in the character of our two major parties. Traditionally, Republicans have always coalesced around the conventional wisdom front-runner for president. Conservatives respect structure, order and party brand names. Not for nothing was the name Nixon, Bush or Dole on the GOP presidential ticket from 1952 to 2004. In contrast, Democrats have favored the presidential candidate with the hot hand, rising from obscurity to the White House -- think Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. But a fresh-out-of-the-oven CNN presidential poll shows a fractured GOP field of newcomers with no clear front-runner while the Democrats have given an unprecedented lead to a brand name of their own: Hillary Clinton. Opinion: GOP strategy on shutdown courts doom . Yes, it is pathetically early to be projecting on the 2016 presidential campaign. Predictive capacity hovers somewhere near zero, and time fixated on polls would be productively used thinking about the 2014 midterms or the fights over the debt ceiling looming over our divided, dysfunctional Congress. But as a snapshot of the underlying dynamics driving the two parties, this new poll is worth a look. On the GOP side of the aisle, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie narrowly leads the fractured field at 17%, one point above Rep. Paul Ryan, best known as Mitt Romney's vice presidential running mate. In the old days, the previous vice presidential nominee would be the future favorite. But that doesn't seem to be the case for Ryan, who emerged from the 2012 presidential race arguably damaged by his association with the Romney campaign. Traditionally, the governor of blue state New Jersey wouldn't be on the GOP radar at all, but Christie -- cruising to a landslide re-election -- seems to be the exception to this and other rules. Next on the list is Rand Paul, the scion of an outsider libertarian movement sparked by his dad's multiple runs for president. But the compelling and controversial one-time eye doctor is a first-term senator from Kentucky, far from your typical presidential timber. Perhaps most interesting is the second tier of GOP candidates. Jeb Bush seems settled in at 10%, despite brand name and legendary brand loyalty. Two Hispanic senate Republicans, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, come in next at 9% and 7% respectively. And then, at the bottom of the barrel, come two 2012 aspirants: Texas Gov. Rick Perry and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum. Far from being strengthened by their 2012 campaigns, these two candidates seem weakened by the experience. Rick Perry's \"oops\" heard round the world still resonates while Santorum's strident social conservatism doesn't seem to be taken seriously by 95% of the party faithful. Strange days. Obama pressures conservative Republicans over possible shutdown . The real news is on the Democratic side. Hillary Clinton has accumulated a towering 55 percentage point lead over her next closest competitor, Vice President Joe Biden, who is at 10% and doesn't exactly lack name recognition. Below Biden are first-term Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren at 7%, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo at 6% and Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley -- perhaps the most openly ambitious of the bunch -- at 2%. Clinton's dominance illustrates an interesting dynamic. Six years ago, she was a far more polarizing figure among Democrats (and independents). Today, after her service as secretary of state, she seems more qualified and less polarizing, transcending her association with the culture of wars concurrent with Bubba's two terms in office. Tough and experienced, Clinton is now positioned as a candidate who rivals Obama's 2007 surge. She will also be positioned as the candidate of the 51%, compelling to women of all ages and even possibly competitive among Republican women in this incarnation. Uncle Joe Biden is well liked by the rank and file, but there doesn't seem to be much of a stampede to put him on the top of the ticket. Warren's strength comes from fascination with the new and represents the growing strength of the liberal base in the party. And while successful governors like Cuomo and O'Malley have earned the right to be taken seriously as presidential candidates, the party faithful don't seem to be much interested in buying what they are selling at the moment. If Clinton does not run for some reason, Democrats will quickly wake up to the awkward fact that they have almost no depth of the bench after two Obama terms. So there you have it: Democrats are behaving like Republicans, falling in line behind the big brand name dominating a race that is still three years away. And Republicans are behaving like Democrats, putting forward a fractured field with no clear front-runners but elevating a New Jersey governor, a Wisconsin congressman and a Kentucky senator to the front of the pack.

{"prompt": "(CNN) -- Argentina have confirmed the appointment of Alejandro Sabella as their new national coach in succession to Sergio Batista. Batista, who had replaced Diego Maradona, was sacked after just eight months in charge following Argentina's Copa America quarterfinal exit to Uruguay earlier this month. That defeat heaped further pressure on Batista, who had been the subject of a media campaign to oust him following some controversial team selections. Batista sacked as Argentina coach . The 56-year-old Sabella was Daniel Passarella's assistant coach with both the Argentina and Uruguay national teams. He then followed Passarella as his number two with club sides Parma in Italy and Corinthians in Brazil. In March 2009, Sabella took his first senior coaching job with Argentine side Estudiantes and just four months later he led them to their first Copa Libertadores title in 39 years. Sabella, who won four caps for his country as a player that took in spells in England with both Leeds and Sheffield United, takes over the Argentina reins despite a previous agreement to coach UAE club side Al Jazira."}
{"prompt": "(CNN) -- Suppose that shortly after 9/11, when it became clear that Osama bin Laden and other members of al Qaeda were responsible for the attacks, President Bush had made the following announcement: . \"Those responsible for these attacks are cowardly, vicious murderers, and we will pursue them to the ends of the earth to capture them. They are not warriors, they are criminals, and they will be treated accordingly. And once we catch them, we will bring them back to the United States and put them on trial right there in lower Manhattan so that a jury of 12 fair-minded New Yorkers can decide their fate.\" Such an announcement would not have been controversial in the slightest and undoubtedly would have been met with widespread approval. After all, putting terrorists on trial in federal court is how we always dealt with terrorists, including the first group of murderers who tried to blow up the World Trade Center. But President Bush didn't say that. Instead, on November 13, 2001, he announced that those responsible would be tried in military commissions, and declared that \"it is not practicable to apply in military commissions . . . the principles of law and the rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts.\" Like many Americans, I did not adequately consider the implications of that statement at the time. More of us should have challenged the president to explain why it was impracticable to apply regular principles of law and rules of evidence to these criminal suspects. In hindsight, it appears likely that the president's real concern was that he knew he had authorized the CIA to detain suspected terrorists in secret prisons and subject them to harsh interrogation methods. Those grossly abusive techniques would taint potential statements and pose a challenge for future criminal trials. Whatever his motivations, the president's decision to jettison the civilian courts in favor of military commissions was a grave misjudgment that diminished our stature in the world and ultimately accomplished nothing. As I witnessed as a military defense lawyer at Guantanamo Bay, the military commissions of the Bush administration were, indisputably, a catastrophic failure. Not a single person responsible for any major terrorist attack was tried. The countless millions of dollars and man-hours devoted to the commissions yielded only three convictions of minor figures, two -- David Hicks and Salim Hamdan -- who received token sentences and were then released. Neither of these defendants was convicted of a traditional war crime, but of providing material support to terrorism, a crime more appropriately tried in federal court. Since 9/11, many Americans have been tried and convicted of this same offense in federal court and received considerably longer sentences than Hicks or Hamdan. The third detainee who was convicted, Ali Hamza al Bahlul (whom I was assigned to represent but who refused to be defended), received a life sentence. Having sat through the trial, I'm quite confident the prosecutors could have achieved the same outcome in federal court. The convictions of  Hamdan and al Bahlul are now on appeal. Because of the many flaws in the law and procedures under which these men were tried, it is by no means certain that their convictions will be upheld. In November 2009, Attorney General Eric Holder made the decision that President Bush should have made eight years earlier, announcing that the 9/11 suspects would be tried in federal district court. This was more than just a symbolic repudiation of Bush era policies -- after eight years of failed efforts to prosecute the men in military commissions, during which hundreds of other terrorists had been tried and convicted in federal court, it was the only logical choice. Unfortunately, Holder also announced that other detainees would be tried in military commissions, creating a two-tiered system of justice. So far, the attorney general has failed to offer any principled basis for which defendants are sent to which forum, leaving many with the disturbing impression that the decisions are based on political, rather than legal, considerations. The latest news reports suggesting the administration is close to reversing itself has only reinforced this view. It's true that the Military Commissions Act of 2009, the third version of the military tribunals, is a substantial improvement over the previous version of the law, which has hastily passed in 2006 in response to the Supreme Court's ruling that the original military commissions created by executive order were unconstitutional. Indeed, \"the principles of law and rules of evidence\" that generally apply in U.S. criminal courts now largely apply to military commissions, ironically proving false President Bush's original justification for the creation of the military commissions -- the alleged impracticability of applying such principles and rules. Yet, even with improvements, the commissions are still a completely untested criminal justice system. The implementing regulations for the new law have yet to be published. The secretary of defense has failed to appoint a new Convening Authority or a new Chief Defense Counsel for the military commissions. The first hearings under this law have been plagued by confusion and delay, and there's every reason to believe that will continue. How much longer should the families of the 9/11 victims have to wait for justice? Perhaps there are sound practical and logistical reasons why the 9/11 trial should not take place in lower Manhattan; that is debatable. But there are no valid reasons why the 9/11 trial should not take place in a federal court under federal law. Let's show the world what distinguishes Americans from our enemies: our reverence for the rule of law and our respect for human rights and due process, even for those we despise. Let the alleged 9/11 co-conspirators have their day in court under fair, time-tested and internationally accepted laws, rules and procedures. If they are guilty of the appalling crimes of which they are accused, the capable prosecutors of the Justice Department (who have far more experience than their military counterparts) will prove it.

{"prompt": "Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- A frenzy of diplomatic activity was underway around the tense Korean peninsula Thursday, with North Korean leader Kim Jong-il reportedly traveling through China, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter visiting Pyongyang, and the Chinese envoy to six-party denuclearization talks landing in Seoul. \"We detected Kim Jong-il's train heading towards China, over the border, at midnight Wednesday,\" a source at South Korea's presidential office said. \"We assume that Kim is aboard the train, and are trying to find out his destination and the purpose of his visit.\" As is common with the secretive state, the visit was unannounced and no agenda has been released. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to questions regarding Kim Jong-il's visit. The North Korean Embassy in Beijing said it had no information regarding the visit. The alleged movement is taking place amid speculation that the ailing Kim, 68, who is believed to have suffered a stroke two years ago, is preparing to officially announce his son, Kim Jong-eun, as his successor. Meanwhile, Carter arrived in Pyongyang Wednesday on a humanitarian mission to negotiate the release of U.S. citizen Aijilon Gomes, believed to be a Christian activist, who is currently imprisoned in the country after entering it illegally in January. Carter was greeted by Kim Gye-gwan, North Korea's chief negotiator at the six-party nuclear talks, and has also met the country's titular head of state, Kim Jong-nam, according to Seoul's Yonhap News agency, quoting North Korean media. There have been hopes of some breakthrough in tense Pyongyang-Washington relations with Carter's visit. Carter's 1994 talks with the late Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il's father, paved the way for the \"Agreed Framework\" the same year, an agreement designed to reign in Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions. Also on Thursday in Seoul, Wu Dawei, vice foreign minister and special representative on Korean Peninsular affairs of China, was in Seoul for talks with Wi Sung-lac. The two men are their country's respective envoys in the currently stalled six-party talks that aim to denuclearize the Korean peninsula. These events come amid intense speculation surrounding North Korea's leadership, given that the state will be holding only its third-ever Workers Party Congress in September. \"The last Congress was in 1966, an enormously important year in North Korean ideology, as that was when their cultural revolution started, when the personality cult went up a huge notch,\" said Brian Myers, a North Korea propaganda expert and author of The Cleanest Race. \"If that is anything to go by, this congress has to be something big.\" Experts do not, however, expect Kim to place his son before the Beijing leadership, and suggested that a China trip is more likely to be economically motivated. North Korea is facing sanctions pressure following a string of nuclear tests, missile launches and, most recently, the sinking of a South Korean warship in March -- which Seoul accuses Pyongyang of carrying out -- meaning Kim could be going cap-in-hand. \"Kim Jong-il, I think, would be looking primarily for expressions of economic support and political support,\" added Mike Chinoy, author of Meltdown: The Inside Story of the North Korean Nuclear Crisis. \"He needs Chinese help to keep his economy afloat and the Chinese remain North Korea's best friend\" But if Kim is, indeed, in China, hopes of an easing in Washington-Pyongyang tensions are lowered. \"Carter is in to get Gomes out, not to try and restart something,\" said Kim Byung-ki, a security expert at Seoul's Korea University. \"If Kim Jong-iI is not there, Carter will not be able to meet the top leader, ask questions, interact and get the atmospherics; he can meet Kim Gye-gwan and Kim Jong-nam, but they are not the center of power.\" With Carter being greeted by Kim Gye-gwan in Pyongyang, and with Wu visiting Seoul, there may be a desire by Pyongyang and/or Beijing to restart stalled denuclearization talks. \"As we understand, Ambassador Wu visited North Korea recently, so I think he will explain what he heard in North Korea and deliver the Chinese view on the resumption of the six-party talks,\" said a Seoul Foreign Ministry official. While the 1994 \"Agreed Framework\" fell apart soon after the George W. Bush administration accused Pyongyang of a secret atomic arms program in 2002, Beijing has invested considerable credibility in sponsoring the six-party talks, designed to denuclearize the Korean peninsula. But the talks, which started in 2003, have made little progress: North Korea has undertaken two nuclear tests and talks themselves have been in abeyance since 2007. China has railed against U.S. and South Korean naval exercises held in the eastern Pacific following the sinking of the South Korean corvette Cheonan in March, perhaps explaining why Beijing wishes for a resumption of dialogue at this time. \"I think Beijing would like to contain any further escalation of military exercises generated as a result of the Cheonan incident,\" said Korea University's Kim. \"It is not in their interest to have a further tightening of the U.S.-Korea-Japan alliance.\" South Korea, however, may be less willing to resume talks, given the talks' history, and given current public anger over the Cheonan, in which 46 sailors died. \"People I speak to in South Korea say they are not in the mood to return to the table unless there is some kind of apology for the sinking of the Cheonan and some clear signs of a serious implementation of denuclearization commitments,\" said Dan Pinkston, of the International Crisis Group's Seoul office. \"If you are Beijing, how can you demonstrate that North Korea is going to return to the table to bargain in good faith?\" CNN's Jo Ling Kent contributed to this story ."}

{"prompt": "(CNN) -- The international Fashion Week crowd has packed up its tents and menagerie of models in New York and moved on to London. After that, it's Milan and finally, Paris. Meanwhile those unfamiliar to the Lincoln Center Fashion Week tents, where runway shows and designer presentations take over the city twice a year, are left wondering in a dust of sequins and a lingering cloud of Chanel No. 5: Why all the fashionable fuss? How does Fashion Week impact me and what I wear daily? \"On a strictly business level, it's a $350 million a year business,\" said Steven Kolb, the CEO of the Council of Fashion Designers of America. \"It's the second largest industry in New York City after finance. It isn't just these design jobs, it's the retail jobs, it's the truckers who drive the deliveries around to stores, it's the editors. It's a big, big business.\" Particularly in New York, Fashion Week is more for the benefit of the buyers, or the people who decide what items to stock in department stores or boutiques for the upcoming season. From there, Fashion Week designs will eventually trickle down into mass market retail. Garments that debuted on the runway this week may not be hanging from the racks of your local T.J.Maxx anytime soon, but you'll see their influence in the shades, patterns and cuts of mass produced items. If the nearly 200 designers who showcased their lines during Fashion Week are any indication, by spring, the masses will be wearing skirt suits, sheer overlays, blush tones, edgy prints, sexy cutouts and head scarves. Tamara Albu, an associate professor of fashion design at Parsons The New School of Design, said even for consumers who are \"just not that into it,\" -- it being fashion -- the industry's influence is unavoidable. \"Whether we like it or not, whether we want it or not, we are constantly bombarded by information, which, of course, includes fashion,\" she said. \"The manufacturers may translate those specific details to more affordable versions that may be trickled down to mass production garments soon after the shows are over. Being totally oblivious about fashion elements would not exclude the fashion from an uninterested person's wardrobe,\" she said. Insiders assert the pomp, circumstance and air kisses of Fashion Week don't just matter to the economy and your closet; they encourage creativity just like events that celebrate any other medium, such as music or fine art. \"It's not just frivolous. It's an entire industry of ideas and marrying the art of commerce with it,\" said Anne Kwon Keane, fashion director for Lucky magazine. And while most runway looks, like the pink feathered Badgley Mischka gown or Tracy Reese's sequined pants, may seem a little extravagant for the business casual set, Keane, Kolb and Albu agree, there's still a takeaway: silhouettes, textures, colors, tailoring details and ideas on how to accessorize. \"It's a presentation of ideas and when thoughtfully put forward the impact can be really wide-reaching,\" Keane said. \"It can be whatever it needs to be to a consumer no matter the price point and that person's personality,\" Kolb said. Others, like New York-based photographer Mike Mellia, remain skeptical. On Thursday, Mellia will open his latest exhibition, \"The Death of Fashion,\" which questions whether Fashion Week \"has become an anonymous repeating stereotype.\" Still Mellia acknowledges fashion's power. \"Fashion's goal is to place itself on an aspirational pedestal because it seeks to transform art into commerce. As a result, the social reach of fashion is often greater than that of traditional art in today's society,\" Mellia said. Are you a fashionista, or do you find the fashion industry irrelevant?

Within minutes he realized both the cooker and the house were on fire. Efforts to put out the blaze failed and the Ellison's home was destroyed. Both she and Pyron escaped unharmed, as did her dog, but her two cats and two birds died in the blaze. Ellison filed an insurance claim with State Farm, and the company paid to put her into a temporary rental property and to repair the damage. Damage to the house was total, but Ellison's insurance company, State Farm, had put her in temporary accommodation and paid to repair the damage. After several months she was able to move back in . After several months she was able to move back into her home. But a year later the letter arrived in the mail specifically naming her as the plaintiff and Pyron as the defendant in the legal action. Neither of them could believe it, and Ellison wondered who was signing her name. It turned out that suit had been filed by State Farm in Ellison's name in a legal process known as 'subrogation', where insurers seek reimbursement when they believe someone else is at fault and should pay for damages. In this case, State Farm accused Pyron of leaving the fryer unattended. Pyron had his own insurance at the time through Farmers, which is providing his attorney free of charge to fight the case. The policy he had at the time covers him up to $300,000 – more than enough to cover the claim. While filed in their names, the lawsuit is actually between the two insurance companies and not Ellison and Pyron. Neither company wants to actually foot the bill for the damage. On paper the lawsuit names Ellison and Pyron as the plaintiff and defendant, but in reality it is their respective insurance companies fighting over which should pay the damages . 'When is it going to end? What's it going to cost me? Will I live long enough to see it?' said Pyron (right) While in the end Pyron probably won't have to pay for the damages, and Ellison technically won't receive a penny, both of them feel anxious to be caught in the middle. 'It's a mess,' Ellison said. They worry constantly about the lawsuit, which has been delayed five times since it was filed in May 2013 in Tarrant County District Court. 'When is it going to end? What's it going to cost me? Will I live long enough to see it?' said Pyron. State Farm declined to comment on the case, but Farmers released a statement: 'We are working diligently to secure all the relevant information necessary to properly defend our customer and hope to resolve this matter soon.' Worse than the stress of the lawsuit, Ellison's homeowner's insurance rocketed to $1,000 per month from $1,200 per year. Not being able to afford the higher rate she is forced to go without coverage."}

After returning to training after suffering a broken vertebra at the World Cup, Neymar could've been forgiven for taking it easy on his return to action with Barcelona. But the Brazilian forward, who only recently began taking part in full training, lit up the Nou Camp as Luis Enrique's side comfortably beat Mexican club Leon 6-0 in a friendly. Neymar scored twice in his first game back after recovering from the serious injury he suffered at the hands - or should that be knee? - of Juan Camilo Zuniga in Brazil's quarter-final victory over Colombia in Fortaleza. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Enrique focussed on team performance despite Suarez debut . Action: Neymar brings the ball forward during his first appearance for Barcelona since returning from injury .

Main man: The Brazilian is congratulated by compatriot and team-mate Dani Alves (right) Serious: Neymar shouts in pain after breaking a vertebra during Brazil's World Cup quarter-final with Colombia . And after shining during four appearances on home soil over the summer, the 22-year-old picked up where he left of as the Catalan giants turned on the style on Monday evening. His first major contribution was to provide the assist for fans' favourite Lionel Messi to open the scoring after just three minutes. And nine minutes later he was on the scoresheet himself. The former Santos star latched onto a pass before running through on goal and chipping the ball over visiting goalkeeper William Yarbrough. Not enough: Yarbrough gets a hand to the ball but couldn't stop Neymar scoring his second goal of the night . Skills: Neymar opts to backheel the ball into an empty net to put Barcelona 3-0 up just before half-time . More to come: Neymar, pictured here celebrating at the Nou Camp, is looking to hit the new season running . VIDEO Enrique focussed on team performance despite Suarez debut . Neymar grabbed his second goal of the night just a minute before half time after combining with Messi once again. The Argentine lifted a clever ball over the top of the Leon defence which Neymar attempted to take round Yarbrough with his first touch, only for the keeper to palm it out to his left. The Brazilian ran on and picked up the loose ball though, cleverly backheeling it into an empty net with his first touch. Although he was replaced by Munir El Haddadi - who scored twice in the second period - at half-time, Neymar did more than enough to suggest that his back injury will have no lasting effects."}

Every morning Sportsmail brings you the biggest gossip and headlines on the continent, giving you your early morning fix from the biggest leagues across Europe. The main focus on the continent on Tuesday is on the return of the Champions League, with Barcelona and Real Madrid unsurprisingly capturing the headlines in Spain. Lionel Messi is emblazoned across the front page of Mundo Deportivo as he goes in search of Raul's all-time Champions League scoring record as Barca face APOEL Nicosia. Lionel Messi (67) and Cristiano Ronaldo (68) go in search of Raul's Champions League record of 71 goals . The Argentinian has scored 67 goals in Europe's premier competition - one fewer than Cristiano Ronaldo and three fewer than Raul. Sport leads with the story that Barca boss Luis Enrique has described Ivan Rakitic as the perfect 'No 10' who can inspire the Catalans to glory this season. In Marca, however, the focus is on Real Madrid as they aim to defend their Champions League crown. Marca claim Real face a 'triple test' to retain the trophy and Sport labels Ivan Rakitic as the perfect 'No 10' According to the newspaper they face a 'triple test' of aiming to become the first side to retain the trophy in the Champions League era, to correct their poor start to the season with a victory over Basle and to convert the booing of Iker Casillas into an 'ovation'. AS, meanwhile, have Ronaldo as their top story with the forward 'pulling the wagon' at the Bernabeu. His 17 goals last season gives the holders hope they can recover from their current slump. Cristiano Ronaldo is described as 'pulling the wagon' at Real Madrid last season by AS due to his 17 goals . Both Milan clubs are given prominence on the front of La Gazetta dello Sport in Italy as they continue their 'revival'.

{"prompt": "Darcy Smith, 41, is accused of having sex with the boy - a former student - when he was just 14 years old and living at their home in Washington state . Former students of a Seattle area teacher charged with rape showed up at a King County courtroom in Kent Thursday to offer their support as she entered a plea of not guilty to a charge of child rape. Students, some alongside their parents, carried signs that said 'We stand by you' and said they don't believe the allegations against Darcy Smith as they packed a Kent, Washington courtroom Thursday. The 41-year-old Renton woman is accused of having sex with a student she took into her home as a troubled 12-year-old. He said they started having sex two years later, sometimes while Smith's husband and children were in the other room. He reported the incidents last year and is now 19. Many of the students on hand in court Thursday told KIRO that Darcy was like a mother to them. And one mother who was there to support Smith--who was once named a regional teacher of the year--can see why. Kim Vea had four children in Smith's classes. She said they even called her \"auntie.\" 'She was the finest I've ever met and she shouldn't be in this situation and I know she's innocent,' Kim Vea, whose children call Smith 'Auntie,' told KIRO. Smith was put on leave in August when the district learned of the investigation. The alleged victim first reported the allegations to the King County Sheriff’s Office last May. Smith has been on administrative leave since August, when her employer, the Highline School District, was informed of the boy’s claims. He told detectives that he and Smith started having sex when he was in the 8th grade and the relationship continued until he moved out of her home at 18. Showing support: Students and parents piled into a Washington courtroom Thursday to show support for Smith, who's charged with having sex with a 14-year-old boy . There were so many people showing support in the courtroom that some had to sit in an overflow area . The boy had moved in with Smith and her family when he was 12 years old and a pupil in her 6th grade class, reports Seattle PI. The unusual arrangement had the blessing of the boy’s mother who didn’t speak English and though Smith would be a good influence on her son whose brother was in a gang. The boy told detective that Smith first showered him with gifts and affection before agreeing to care for him full time, according to charging papers. But the victim said things would change in the evenings when the kids and Smith's husband went to bed, and she drank wine. According to the documents, the victim said Smith made him promise not to tell anyone or 'she would go to jail and be in big trouble if he told.' The McMicken Heights sixth-grade teacher is free without bail until her next court appearance March 12. Smith pleaded not guilty on Thursday to a child rape charge stemming from incidents the victim claims spanned years .

Todd is no blood relation to me, but we’re real close.’ Robin’s first two wives, Valerie Velardi, whom he was wed to from 1978 to 1988 and Marsha Garces Williams, whom he was married to from 1989 to 2008, have yet to comment on his passing.

She said: ‘This morning, I lost my husband and my best friend, while the world lost one of its most beloved artists and beautiful human beings. Many loved him: Robin Williams and his ex- wife Marsha Garces Williams whom he was married to from 1989 to 2008 . ‘I am utterly heartbroken ...

She remembers how he used to give her and her friends lifts in his car, a red BMW, as youngsters. She said: ‘He used to pick us up after we’d been hitchhiking. He was so funny.  I used to have a horse who used to get loose and eat his wife’s flowers.  And she would scream at me and he’d come out and say “oh, its OK they’re just kids.”' Missed by family: Robin Williams posing with family members Cody, Zeldaand wife Marsha during Williams' hand and footprint ceremony outside the Mann's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood . ‘I was between around eight and eleven at the time. ‘He was crazy, he would pick us up if he saw us trying to get home, and he would do jokes and try and scare us in the backseat, he was just so funny. ‘He was particularly nice to me because his wife would scream at me all the time. ‘Whenever we saw him we’d flag his car down to get rides. We knew he’d be a fun person to hang with on the way home. And he always made sure we got home safe and he dropped us at our door. ‘To hear that he [took his own life] makes me think there is a whole layer of depression I don’t know about, and that I am thankful I don’t know about.’ Marin County Sherriff’s office have released statement saying they received a call at approximately midday saying a male adult had been found unconscious and that Robin was later pronounced dead at the scene.

{"prompt": "West Ham chairman David Sullivan has admitted he regrets signing Andy Carroll for a club-record £15million. And the Hammers supremo has added to simmering tensions between the board and Sam Allardyce after contradicting his manager’s comments about Ravel Morrison. Carroll is set to miss the next four months after suffering torn ankle ligaments and has flown to Baltimore for surgery. It is a huge blow to Allardyce, who was desperate for his striker to stay injury-free next season. VIDEO Scroll down to watch crocked West Ham striker Andy Carroll in latest kit launch . Out: Andy Carroll is out for four months with torn ligaments in his left ankle . Mistake? David Sullivan regrets putting all of his 'eggs in one basket' with the signing of Carroll . Allardyce played a lead role in ensuring West Ham turned Carroll’s loan move from Liverpool during the 2012-13 season into a permanent deal but the striker made just 16 appearances for the Hammers last season after a series of fitness problems. Sullivan admits that in hindsight, spending big money on Carroll, 25, was not a wise move. ‘It was desperate last year, we probably made a mistake by putting all our eggs in one  basket (by signing Carroll),’ he told talkSPORT. ‘Had we known what we know now we wouldn’t have signed the player. But it’s easy to be wise after the event. ‘We were assured by our physio — who has since left the club —that the player would be available for the start of the season. ‘He wasn’t available until  January or February. A mistake was made and we were given the wrong information. ‘We based our decision and our purchase of the player on what the medical department told us. We’ve changed everything in that department as a result of that. On his day he is a devastating and fantastic player, we’ve just got to get him back to his best. SEPTEMBER 2012Misses a month after straining a hamstring against Fulham . DECEMBER 2012Twists his knee against Man Utd and is out for two months . MAY 2013Falls awkwardly and damages his heel against Reading and is out for seven months . ‘But at the same time we can’t start the season with the strikeforce we’ve got. I don’t think it’s good enough, there’s not enough height in it and if we get another injury, in terms of quantity, it’s insufficient, so we have to sign at least one more player.’ The club are now pressing ahead with plans to sign a new striker, with Monaco’s Lacina Traore among the names being considered. ‘We have to bring in another striker and we’re working on it now to buy one, or loan one, or both,’ Sullivan added. ‘You can never have enough strikers and really with Andy gone we haven’t got enough.’ Meanwhile, the Hammers board and Allardyce appear to be at odds over Ravel Morrison’s future. He is back at West Ham following his loan move to QPR last season. Allardyce, who was close to losing his job this summer, has said he is not part of his plans for next season, but Sullivan has contradicted his manager,  saying: ‘Sam has said Ravel is not part of his plans but we do — as a board — see him as part of our plans. ‘I think he said in a press  conference, if I read it correctly, he’s not part of his plans for this season. ‘I think he said that in New Zealand but we don’t agree with that. We would like to sit down and give him a longer contract.’ ‘We do like him, we do see him as part of the long-term future of the club but we have to agree it with the manager because there’s no point signing a player he’s not going to play.’ Hunt: Sullivan also revealed that West Ham will now be on the search for a striker .

Do you love watching The Only Way is Essex, Jeremy Kyle and The Great British Bake Off but hate admitting it? Don't worry, you're not alone. A new study has found many of us have programmes which we regularly sit down to enjoy - but prefer to keep our guilty pleasure to ourselves. The latest adventures of Joey Essex, Sam Faiers and Lucy Mecklenburgh on TOWIE came top of the pile, while Jeremy Kyle’s show and The Great British Bake Off came second and third respectively in the poll. The Only Way really IS Essex! A new study has revealed that Brits love watching TOWIE but hate to admit it . The study revealed that while many may be quick to insist they are avid viewers of high-brow programmes like Newsnight, it's actually the antics of the TOWIE cast and lure of conflict and emotional drama of Jeremy Kyle that have viewers hooked. Other guilty pleasures include tea-time drama Hollyoaks and Strictly Come Dancing. Brits are also keeping their love of Storage Hunters secured tightly as the show where treasure seekers bid on garages full of junk made the top ten. The report found that the average TV viewer clocks up over 25 hours of television in an average week - more than 1,266 hours a year - which may explain why over a third said they love nothing more than a night in front of the box. Guilty pleasures: Jeremy Kyle's show and The Great British Bake Off came second and third respectively in the poll of our favourite TV shows that we hate admitting to watching . The study also saw Downton Abbey voted the most popular programme in recent times by the average British viewer. Dr Helen Wheatley of the University of Warwick said: 'This report shows the versatility of TV as a medium. 'The research shows that people continue to turn to television for entertainment, to learn new things, to become absorbed in the twisting plot lines of a television drama, but also to indulge in \"guilty pleasures\". 'It is clear that whilst viewers simultaneously find a wide range of programmes fascinating and compelling, they also worry about what their viewing habits say about them.' Past times: The study also saw Downton Abbey voted the most popular programme in recent times by the average British viewer .

{"prompt": "One is a toddler who desperately needed an operation to walk, the other an aspiring topless model who wanted a ‘boob job’ to look more like Jordan. And there are no prizes for guessing which case the NHS deemed the more urgent. The health service was yesterday accused of showing a ‘skewed sense of priorities’ after it emerged that Oliver Dockerty, a two-year-old boy with cerebral palsy, has been turned down for funding for an operation which could allow him to walk. Priorities: Little Oliver Dockerty, left, was refused funding for an operation which could help him walk while aspiring model Josie Cunning, right, had her breasts enlarged to 36DD at a cost of £4,800 to taxpayers . Yet just a few miles away, 22-year-old . Josie Cunningham has been given size 36DD breasts at taxpayers’ expense . because she convinced doctors her flat chest was ‘ruining her life’. The two cases from Leeds have emerged . after Oliver’s mother spoke out about how he has been denied the . potentially life-changing procedure. The toddler, who relies on a frame to . move around, can have the operation only if his single mother Claire can . raise £25,000  to have it performed privately. Miss Dockerty, 30, said: ‘Oliver has . splints on his legs, a flexi-stand as he hasn’t got any balance, and . uses a walking frame to get around. ‘He wants to be jumping in muddy . puddles like Peppa Pig. He wants to be kicking a football and he can’t . jump on a trampoline. I’d love to see him walking unaided for his first . day at primary school. ‘I’m a single parent and I don’t have . that kind of money. Even if they look again at the decision, there’s . going to be a big backlog of children like Oliver waiting to have this . done.’ Turned down: Oliver, who has cerebral palsy, with mother Claire, needs a metal frame to walk . Oliver, who lives with his mother in Manchester, was referred . for surgery at Leeds General Infirmary, which specialises in the . procedure, known as  selective dorsal rhizotomy. But when a surgeon applied to NHS . England for funding, he was turned down because the procedure is not yet . routinely covered by the health service. The case seems particularly cruel when . compared to that of Miss Cunningham, who had a breast enlargement on . the NHS at nearby St James’s University Hospital, which is also part of . the Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust. Under NHS guidelines, cosmetic surgery . should be funded only in rare circumstances when a local trust deems it . is needed ‘to protect a person’s health’. Outrage: Claire Dockerty, whose son Oliver, two, needs a specialist operation in order to walk without a frame, slammed the NHS for refusing to pay for the operation . But Miss Cunningham, who works in . telesales, convinced doctors that having a flat chest was causing her . emotional distress. After funding was recommended by her GP and approved . by her local primary care trust, she had a £4,800 operation, increasing . the size of her breasts from 32A to 36DD. She now says she has the ‘confidence’ to pursue her dream of topless modelling and hopes to emulate former . Page 3 girl Katie Price, also known as Jordan. The unmarried mother from Leeds plans . to leave her children, Harley, five, and Frankie, two, with her parents . while she chases her dream. She wrote on Twitter: ‘I have no regrets. My . body is the start of my new life.’ Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of . the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Taxpayers will be stupefied that the . same system  which funded a boob job for  an aspiring glamour model will . not allow treatment that would enable a little boy to walk unaided. ‘It . certainly suggests that the NHS has a skewed sense of priorities.’ A spokesman for NHS England said . funding was granted for the operation recommended for Oliver in only . ‘exceptional cases’, adding that proposals are being considered to offer . it more widely later in the year.’ A spokesman for the Department of . Health said: ‘Any treatment provided by the NHS needs to be clinically . justified, but the local NHS is best placed to make these decisions.’ Meanwhile, Claire is determined to fund the operation for her son herself and has launched her own charity page at justgiving.com/oliverwantstojoinin . Cosmetic procedures are not normally done on the NHS unless doctors decide there is a clinical need. This decision is taken at a local level, by local clinical commissioners under the new NHS reform, on the basis of reports submitted by a patient's doctors. Commissioners set their own criteria according to what, in their view, are the health needs of the local community. For cosmetic surgery, the usual protocol is that the commissioners must decide there is some kind of clinical, ie health, need for the operation to be funded on the NHS. Simply wanting to look nicer in itself is not reason enough. Leeds Primary Care Trust, also known as NHS Leeds, offers a list of cosmetic procedures that may be available on its website. They include breast augmentation, breast reduction, eyelid surgery (blepharoplasty), and rhytidectomy (wrinkle removal including face lift). It says these may be available 'providing certain criteria can be met', and lists the criteria. The criteria required for breast augmentation include suffering from certain rare syndromes, severe asymmetry (more than two cup sizes difference), or lumpectomy that results in deformity. Rare cases, however, such as Ms Cunningham's, have to be go through the Individual Funding Request process, in which each case is decided upon its individual merits. Video courtesy of Daybreak ."}

Australians have become more daring in the bedroom, with risque sexual acts practised more frequently and being embraced at younger ages . Compared to a decade ago, people have become more open to premarital sex, abortion and homosexuality, liberating couples to engage in a varied sex life . Around 20,000 people aged between 16 and 69 told researchers over the phone that on average they have sex approximately 1.4 times a week, less than 0.4 times than Australians a decade ago. The younger they were, the more sex they were having but even people in their 60s admitted to engaging in the practice at least once a week. Professor Juliet Richters, lead researcher from UNSW, said that the frequency of sex among those surveyed came as a shock. 'We thought it was a mistake, but a recent British national survey had the same finding,' Professor Richters told The Age. With technology taking over our daily routine, Professor Richters suggests the time spent online could be impacting our sex lives. 'I would have thought take a mobile phone to bed might have something to do with it', she said.

Even though people these days are having less sex, nearly 90 per cent of men and 75 per cent of women admit that they are very much enjoying their sexual encounters. The country's largest study of sexual activity and attitudes  found that over 92 per cent of heterosexual people are having vaginal sex, 86 per cent of men and 80 per cent of women are engaging in oral sex and 25 per cent of men and 19 per cent of women have had anal sex. Oral and anal sex was more common among 30 to 49 year-olds. 'We're entering a more exploratory, diverse time,' said Dr Chris Rissel, public health researcher from The University of Sydney. 'I think what we've probably got is a less dramatic change than the 1960s but across a wider range of the population. We've got more exploration, more diversity, across a wider age group.' Nearly half of the people under 60 also admitted to watching pornography compared to a decade ago.

{"prompt": "(CNN) -- A recent CNN.com op-ed asked \"Was the Shell Oil hoax ethical?\" We at Greenpeace, along with the activist group Yes Men, are behind the Shell Oil website ArcticReady.com, which we created to call attention to the company's Arctic destruction. So we were intrigued by this question. The writer, Paul Root Wolpe, director of the Center for Ethics at Emory University, said the spoof website did not announce itself as a parody and that omission could be called misrepresentation. And that could possibly be called unethical. But we revealed our role just hours after the site went up, and the site is so over-the-top -- it has a kids' game called \"Angry Bergs\" -- that people realize very quickly that it is fake. But mispresentation is Wolpe's concern, which is why he should have addressed the ethics of Shell's multibillion-dollar international hoax perpetrated on Earth itself. A hoax the company has failed to reveal to the public. Royal Dutch Shell made $31 billion in profits last year, while its CEO took home $15 million in compensation during one of the worst economic crises in a century. The company's lobbyists in Washington, London and other global capitals work to slow the development of clean technologies and renewable energy, preferring instead a status quo that benefits their shareholders and leaves the massive costs of climate change to the 99%. And yet Shell proudly advertises itself as a corporation deeply concerned with developing clean energy and ensuring a viable energy future, even going to great lengths to organize well-branded \"eco-marathons\" completely at odds with its relentless fossil fuel extraction. In the Arctic, the oil giant is exploiting melting sea ice to drill for more of the oil causing global warming in the first place. All of this is happening despite clear evidence from the best scientists that global warming is already causing extreme weather events and it's only likely to get worse. In the past few weeks, Shell's communications team has been busy trying to spin its way out of a series of recent crises, but it can't change the facts. The Shell fleet's 14,000-ton drill ship in Alaska, the Discoverer, slipped anchor two weeks ago. The same drill ship can't meet the Clean Air Act standards the company agreed to earlier this year, and so Shell is asking the EPA to bend the rules at the 11th hour. An oil spill response barge, the Arctic Challenger, which Shell promised the U.S. Coast Guard was \"Arctic ready,\" is in Washington state, beset with technical problems. The company plays down these events and seeks to reassure investors that these major errors are par for the course, but these systematic attempts to mislead the public are clearly unethical. Shell has been relentlessly conducting its own PR campaign to distort the truth about what the company is doing in the Arctic. To get the truth out, we wanted to make a website that imagined a world in which Shell was a little less guarded about the implications of drilling for oil in Alaska. We asked ourselves: What if Shell really did ask people what they thought? What would that look like? We came up with ArcticReady.com. The response has been staggering -- nearly 4 million page views, 12,000 user-generated ads and a cascade of tweets. This reaction from the public shows Shell has serious problems in the court of public opinion, and that it ignores Arctic defenders at its peril. By using the most popular form of contemporary communication -- social media -- to bypass Shell's billions, our supporters undermined the company's social license to operate and brought global attention to its greed and willful ignorance of science. The site is a parody. And when people realize it's a parody, they like it even more. We've announced it as a parody after it went up and over and over again in the media since then. We have an ad generator: We provide a gallery of photos and readers provide the captions. New ads keep pouring in. People clearly want an opportunity to tell Shell what they think of the company's Arctic drilling program, and our site has provided them with a voice. It's also highlighted some of the major environmental issues with Arctic drilling that have been green-washed away.  For example, the U.S. granted Shell an \"incidental harassment permit\" allowing the company to work near whales and seals while drilling this summer, which could interfere with their breathing, breeding and nursing.  To put this issue forward, we created an online \"Mercy Poll\" in which users can vote for which Arctic mammal they'd like Shell to harass the least as a funny way to draw attention to these brutal facts. But Shell and its sympathizers would like people to talk about Greenpeace and the Yes Men rather than what the company is doing in the Arctic. That's fine. We welcome the discussion. As Wolpe himself says, \"Let's keep it clean, everyone -- tell us who you are, and then take your best shot.\" We're Greenpeace and the Yes Men, and we're ready to sit down with Shell any time to debate the ethics of Arctic drilling. Let's go. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Travis Nichols."}
{"prompt": "By . Chris Hastings . They are two of Britain’s most acclaimed comedy writers, between them responsible for  The Young Ones, Blackadder and Four Weddings And A Funeral. But there is one BBC sitcom so bizarre, and deemed such a dud, that it has been airbrushed from the CVs of Ben Elton and Richard Curtis – and never screened in the 30 years since it was made. The pair wrote a show in  which Margaret Thatcher was a space alien who had been recalled to Mars – then replaced as  Prime Minister by Suggs from  the pop group Madness, with his bandmates as the Cabinet. The show called 'Madness' featuring the band was never commissioned by BBC 2 and the pilot show was never broadcast . A clip from the show, called simply Madness, will be seen for the first time tonight as part of BBC2’s 50th birthday celebrations. Described as a ‘dummy run which didn’t make it out of the starting blocks’, the show was never commissioned as a series. Jokes in the 1984 episode – in which the seat of power has been transplanted to a room above a cafe – include one musician telling Suggs: ‘Prime Minister, I don’t want to scare you – but boo!’ In another scene Suggs discovers that he has carried saxophonist Lee Thompson all the way from Kentish Town in North London to Downing Street in his saxophone case. An unrepentant Thompson tells Suggs, ‘You ought to be glad I don’t play the piano’, and Suggs turns directly to the camera and says: ‘Good point!’ The clips are included in a documentary called The Comedy Vaults: BBC2’s Hidden Treasure, which celebrates trial shows ‘made for little money and usually not for public consumption’. Other clips include scenes from Miranda Hart’s Joke Shop from 2008, which became the hugely successful Miranda, and the now forgotten Guess Who’s Coming  To Dinner, in which Anne Robinson asked celebrities for their ideal dinner party guests. In the pilot, Ricky Gervais tells the Weakest Link host ‘not to try any of your fascist prostitute stuff’. Another of the shows which had never been broadcast featured Alan Bennett . The documentary also includes a recently discovered performance from Alan Bennett in his 1966 series On The Margin. The playwright, who turned 80 on Friday, plays a businessman who signs off a telegram to his wife with ‘Norwich’, which he explains is code for ‘Nickers off, ready when I come home’. Until the clip was found, it had been assumed the entire series of On The Margin had been wiped by the BBC. Tonight’s documentary, which airs at 9pm, also includes footage of Dudley Moore and Peter Cook in their stage show Behind The Fridge, which has not been shown on British TV for 45 years, and the pilot episode of QI from 2002.

{"prompt": "(CNN)  -- Jordan Belfi has a great job: He plays Adam Davies on the HBO show \"Entourage,\" a comedy series that takes a look at the life of a young actor, Vincent Chase, and the old friends who surround him in Hollywood. Jordan Belfi arrives at the premiere of \"Entourage\" season six in Los Angeles, California. Davies is one of the few characters on the show who has the ability to shake one of the central figures: the unshakeable agent Ari Gold. Belfi has been around since the early days of \"Entourage\" and remembers the humble beginnings of his character's career as an agent under Gold's direction. Since that first season, Davies has risen to become Ari's chief rival on the show. Belfi believes conveying the tension between him and Ari is easy, based on the great material he's given. \"It's a testament to the writing by Doug Ellin, the creator of the show. It's just on the page,\" Belfi said. \"When you get setups and writing and dialogue and scenes that good, it makes your job that much easier.\" CNN talked to Belfi, who's also in the movie \"Surrogates\" (opening Friday), about his experiences on the show and his inspiration for the role. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN:  A lot of fans really missed that rivalry between you and Ari Gold. Talk a little about how you and Jeremy Piven kind of prepare for that and try to make that real on screen. Belfi: Adam Davies has become ... one of the few characters on the show that really knows how to get under Ari's skin and push his buttons. Ari is an entertaining character, and it's fun to watch him go after things, but people really enjoy kind of when Ari's off balance. That interplay, that back and forth, particularly the sort of thing that's happening now [on the show], the constantly one-upping each other, is just really fun to watch. It's entertaining. And I get that response from a lot of the fans of the show. They love Adam Davies for that reason because he just knows how to do it. Jeremy ... [is] an actor with so much power and force and impact that you're sort of forced to up your game. You're really present in the moment. And when you're there and you're really going back and forth, that's when the sparks really fly. CNN: Talk little bit about the inspiration you draw from to play Adam Davies. Belfi: I started way back on season one in the beginning of the show. And back then, Adam Davies was still in his cubicle. So a lot of the inspiration came from meetings I had when I was starting out -- you know, behavior I experienced from agents and other industry people when I was starting out. I was in a not-too-dissimilar position. ... And I think that's what people really respond to. There's an absolute foundation of truth -- almost scary truth -- to the things Adam says, the things Ari does, all that kind of stuff. And it's why it's such a visceral experience for people in the industry and fun for people that happen not to be in the industry. CNN: What are your thoughts on Adam Davies as a person? Belfi: What gives Ari a little bit of his soul, his heart, is that we have all these scenes with his wife and his family, and you really get to see him as a dad. ... [But] we haven't gotten to see any of the personal life of Adam Davies. So I don't know if there's anything yet to kind of balance out those ruthless qualities he has. But I think he's the kind of agent that I'd certainly like to have if you're that actor trying to go after that job. You want that agent who's going to beg, borrow and steal to help prove that you're the guy. So in that respect, it seems like he's someone you'd want on your side. And the thing is, I think that's what made the rivalry between him and Ari so great. You know when he was coming up, he probably did a lot of the same things [as Ari] and ran over people in similar kinds of ways. They're really kind of the same in a lot of ways. So you're either best friends or mortal enemies when you share that much in common with somebody. CNN: Exempting Davies, who's your favorite character on the show and why? Belfi: Ah! Impossible question! I have to exempt Adam Davies from the answer? ... If I absolutely, gun-to-my-head have to choose, there's a quality about [Chase's brother] Drama that I've always loved. And it was maybe more prominent in the first couple of seasons than it is now because it's evolved slightly. The quality that I always found the most entertaining, is that Drama was always this mix of desperation and simultaneous pride. And that's really funny. You know at the beginning he was just scratching, begging for something, some chunk of the game or to get back in the game. But he simultaneously kind of knows it all. And that mix is a great comedic mix, comedic recipe. It was both funny and heartbreaking.   CNN: Of course, our diehard \"Entourage\" fans would love to get some scoop on the coming story lines. You've gotta give us something. Belfi: A little something? Well, I don't think I'd be giving away too much to say that Adam might get Lloyd. In terms of the story line, there's some stuff that I'm told with Drama and his going after this role on \"Melrose Place\" and the screen test for that role and the ups and downs of that. And also, some big things happen between Eric and Sloane. But in terms of the really exciting stuff between Adam Davies and Ari, I guess I'll say this: At the end of season two, when Ari is trying to form his coup, to break up the agency, and Adam is the one who rats him out and gets him fired and humiliated and causes that whole thing ... In the amazing way that Doug has constructed it, all that stuff from the end of season two comes full circle. There's this one thing that happens that will really stand out and that people will talk about. So some fun, exciting stuff to look forward to."}

{"prompt": "By . Jonathan O'Callaghan for MailOnline . Scientists say they now have firm evidence that our solar system is contained inside a large ‘bubble’. They say that 10 million years ago a nearby cluster of supernovas went off like 'popcorn' and blew an enormous bubble in the interstellar medium that we now inhabit. Called the ‘Local Bubble’, this peanut-shaped area 300 light-years across reveals why there is very little of the dust and gas seen elsewhere in the universe in our vicinity. Scroll down for video explanation . Researchers at the University of Miami say they have found evidence that our solar system is inside a 'bubble' (diagram shown) where there is no dust and gas seen elsewhere in the interstellar medium. The Local Bubble theory suggests that this material was blasted away be supernovas millions of years ago . The Local Bubble was first postulated in the 1970s and 1980s, but the existence of it had been contested. At the time, when astronomers looked around our solar system, they found an odd lack of gas and dust seen in the interstellar medium elsewhere in the universe . Meanwhile, astronomers had begun detecting an abundance of X-ray radiation around Earth. This suggested that our solar system was mostly empty because radiation from supernovas had blasted away our interstellar medium. While these supernovas were not enough to exterminate life on Earth, they were close enough to wrap our solar system in a bubble of hot gas that persists today. Contesting the theory, however, some scientists said that the X-rays could be accounted for by the sun. They claimed that something known as ‘charge exchange’ could be to blame, which involves solar wind causing X-ray radiation by ‘stealing’ electrons from neutral gas in space. To see which theory was true, researchers from the University of Miami launched a sounding rocket, one that flies into space on a short trip and back, from White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico in December 2012. There is a stream of interstellar helium atoms that flows through the solar system. Every year in December, Earth passes through the 'helium focusing cone,' a region where this neutral helium is concentrated by the gravitational influence of the sun. The researchers figured the helium focusing cone was probably the strongest source of charge exchange X-rays in the solar system. Using the sounding rocket, they measured the X-ray glow of the helium and found that it could not account for all of the X-rays astronomers had been seeing. There must be a Local Bubble of hot gas to account for the difference. The rocket reached a peak altitude of 160 miles (260 km) and spent five minutes above the atmosphere, carrying with it an x-ray detector called the Diffuse x-ray emission from the Local Galaxy (DXL). During the flight, DXL found that 40 per cent of soft x-rays detected originated in the solar system. The rest, researchers surmised in their paper in the journal Nature, must come from a Local Bubble of hot gas left over from supernovas explosions. 'This is a significant discovery,' said Professor Massimiliano Galeazzi, who led the research. '[It] affects our understanding of the area of the galaxy close to the sun, and can, therefore, be used as a foundation for future models of the galaxy structure.' Galeazzi and collaborators are already planning the next flight of DXL, which will include additional instruments to better characterise the emission. The launch is currently planned for December 2015. Evidence suggests that many supernovas exploded like 'popcorn' near our solar system millions of years ago, leaving their radiation behind as a signature of their action. In this image a supernova remnant lies in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), a small galaxy about 170,000 light-years from Earth ."}

The rare two pence piece, which is made in the wrong metal, which is set to sell for up to £1,000 when it is auctioned next week . It is thought that a cupronickel blank had been left in the barrel during the minting process by mistake. Richard Brommell, from Charterhouse Auctions, believes the coin could fetch up to £1,000 when it is auctioned in Sherborne, Dorset, on Friday. He said: ‘It’s a conversation piece and a curio. The Royal Mint can produce the odd anomaly but this takes the biscuit. It’s a very difficult thing to value because there are no comparables. ‘We say £100 to £200 as an estimate, but if two people are bidding for it, the coin could go for more than £1,000.’"}
{"prompt": "Controversial wannabe glamour model Josie Cunningham, 24, has claimed she doesn't mind being branded Britain's most hated woman and believes she has 'as big a brain as I have boobs' NHS boob job scrounger Josie Cunningham has claimed she doesn't mind being branded Britain's most hated woman and believes she has 'a bigger IQ than the majority of people'. The 24-year-old, who shot to notoriety after boasting about having a £4,800 breast enlargement on the NHS, described herself as 'very intelligent' before exclaiming: 'I've got as big a brain as I have boobs'. The mother of three, from Leeds, who is set to star in a new documentary called Josie: The Most Hated Woman in Britain?, has also revealed how she once applied to the Royal Navy, but had to forgo joining after falling pregnant. It comes after Miss Cunningham, who announced her engagement to fiancé Andrew Goy last month, revealed she would be holding a party at the end of the month to celebrate the two-year anniversary of her breast augmentation. Ahead of her new television show, which is set to air on Channel 4 tonight, the controversial glamour model said she doesn't mind the criticism she receives because she is 'actually hard-working'. Speaking to Newsbeat, she said: 'Everybody just thinks I'm this fame-hungry b**** but actually I'm a hard-working parent. 'I think people are slowly realising there is a game there to be played. 'It's a whole case of don't hate the player - hate the game. 'All this hatred that comes with my name I'd say is worth it because I've got my name out there so much more from being hated. 'All of a sudden everybody knew my name so thanks for that - it's been great.' Her comments came as she revealed she applied to the Royal Navy when she was 16-years-old and claimed officials wanted her to be in charge of weapons after she topped the IQ test. She told The Sun's Antonella Lazzeri: 'I got the top marks in the class. I'd never done an IQ test but it was so easy. 'In fact I'm very intelligent. People think I'm stupid but I'm not. I've got as big a brain as I have boobs. 'I know I'm much brighter than most people because I missed about a year of school thanks to being bullied really badly, but still managed to pass eight GCSEs.' She claimed that she did 'so well' in the IQ test that the Navy wanted her to be a warfare specialist, putting her in control of warship weapons and the coordinates. The real-life documentary about Miss Cunningham follows her day-to-day life and shows her revelling in attention from paparazzi and members of the public. Miss Cunningham, who announced her engagement to 33-year-old fiancé Andrew Goy last month (pictured together above), said she is 'actually very intelligent' and claimed she doesn't mind any negative criticsm . A real-life documentary about Miss Cunningham (pictured leaving hospital with her newborn daughter and agent Rob Cooper last year) called Josie: The Most Hated Woman in Britain? is set to air on Channel 4 tonight . Miss Cunningham's agent confirmed on Twitter that the documentary would be screened on TV this month . It is set to air just over a month after she revealed she had got engaged to her 33-year-old body-building boyfriend by sharing a photo of her pink heart-shaped engagement ring online. The announcement, which was later confirmed by a representative for Miss Cunningham, came just weeks after the couple were first pictured together in Leeds city centre. There have been reports that Miss Cunningham is pregnant with Goy's child. Last November, Miss Cunningham revealed she had wrongly told one man that he was the father of her baby daughter Grace by sending him the wrong DNA result. She had asked three men to take a paternity test to determine who was Grace's father and wrote the outcome in cards to be delivered in time for Christmas Day. But she allegedly mixed up the notes and sent the positive result to the wrong man. Miss Cunningham shared her blunder with her Twitter followers before comparing her life to an episode of EastEnders. It came after the mother, who also has two sons aged six and three, revealed she was planning to abort her baby for the chance to appear on Celebrity Big Brother. However, she later claimed she 'changed her mind' after discovering her baby was to be a little girl. The 24-year-old (pictured heavily pregnant last year) former escort, from Leeds, revealed she would be holding a party at the end of the month to celebrate the two-year anniversary of her breast augmentation . Josie Cunningham became a household name when she admitted undergoing £4,800 worth of breast enhancement surgery paid for by the NHS to increase her bust from a 32A to 36DD. She claimed she needed the surgery because she had been bullied since the age of 14 for being flat chested. Later it also emerged that she received Botox on the NHS over a 'sweat problem'. Miss Cunningham's most controversial outburst came when she publicly considered aborting her unborn child because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Channel 5's Big Brother. The mother of three later said she was receiving negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school. The former escort made headlines again when she said she wanted a nose job - funded by the public. She set up a website called fundmynose.co.uk to encourage people to donate towards the £3,000 cosmetic operation. She claimed she was fed up of people comparing her to The Muppets’ Miss Piggy and said she wanted a brand new nose which is a ‘cross between Michelle Keegan and Jennifer Aniston’. It came after the wannabe glamour model, who previously worked a stint as a £1,000-a-night escort girl, told female students 'not to worry' if their exam results were not quite what they were hoping for. Miss Cunningham made headlines after having £4,800 breast enlargement surgery paid for by the NHS . Ahead of national A-level exam results being released in August last year, she tweeted: 'Good luck to everyone getting your A-level results today. Girls don't worry if ur results are poor - you can always have a career getting your t***s out or escorting. (Obviously if your over 18!). #Josie'sCareerAdvice' Towards the end of last year, the controversial wannabe glamour model stepped out with a Girl Power painting sprawled over her heavily pregnant bump, before announcing she would be setting up a trust fund to pay for her daughter's boob job. It came after she decided not to abort her unborn baby afterall because she 'wanted a daughter'. Afterwards, she decided to sell tickets to the live birth of her child. Four tickets to the home birth had sold out in just 14 minutes - netting her £30,000. It is thought that three of the four tickets were purchased by journalists while the fourth is believed to have been bought by somebody described as 'a super-fan'. She later said that 50 fans would be able to log on to the video chat service Skype and watch the former prostitute's delivery via videolink. At one point, Miss Cunningham suggested she would reimburse the NHS for the cost of her controversial breast enhancement surgery. Using the hashtag #BritishPublic0JosieCunningham1, Josie said she made the decision because '80% of the country are against' her. However, she later said she had had a change of heart."}
{"prompt": "For those hoping that a decent rugby game had arrived, think again. For Sidhe’s Rugby Challenge 2 takes all fans’ wishes and boots them firmly into touch. A lot of this is down to fundamental flaws in its gameplay. Looking past the shoddy animation and terrible character models, the AI just can’t understand formation. Not fun: Although these screens look promising, in action, the game doesn't capture the sport very well . This effectively takes away any sort of structured attack – resulting in most matches looking like a blend of hot potato and playground favourite ‘IT’. Passing is clunky and unresponsive – a quick tap firing the ball the length of the pitch one minute or an ineffective pop pass the next. At the breakdown, it’s nearly impossible to use your backs given how fast (and offside) the other team close you down and the ref will almost always get in the way. Defence is not much better. Simply putting the controller down is almost as effective as playing. The AI will tackle anything that moves, while the clunky battle at the breakdown doesn’t really take into account team momentum. When playing against the computer, rarely does the opposition’s scrum-half manage to pass it wide, opting mostly to charge in himself. Then there are the set pieces – which are some of the most boring yet in the genre. Scrums involve pushing two thumbsticks the direction you want your team to push. And kicking and line-outs are a case of timed presses when at the correct point on a metre. Not only that, but there are a complete lack of set-plays, so any tactics go out of the window. You’re also constrained to using a behind-the-action camera view. Although it gives you the choice of a sideline and closer-to-the-action camera, both are nigh on unplayable. The best thing about this game are the graphics, but even these fall well short. Given the attempted TV-style presentation during matches, it’s hard to avoid the shoddy, gormless character models that plague each cutscene. Boring: Scrums and other set pieces are cumbersome and the lack of set plays does nothing to help matters . Equally poor is the game’s commentary. With the likes of Grant Nisbett and All Black legend Justin Marshall at the helm, it’s a shame that it just doesn’t work. Both are equally annoying, and chime in with observations that rarely have anything to do with what’s going on. ‘I agree’ is as far as interaction between the two go and the historical facts Nisbett treats you to before each match are equally as stilted. All of the above obliterate any sort of redeeming qualities the game features – be that a large selection of licensed teams, varied game modes (including the Lions tour) and character customisation.

{"prompt": "By . Tim Shipman . PUBLISHED: . 17:03 EST, 11 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:53 EST, 11 September 2012 . MPs have been given free corporate tickets to the most sought-after event at the Olympics – the men’s 100m final. Four members of the culture media and sport select committee have accepted the prized seats from BT, one of London 2012’s leading sponsors. Ministers have been banned from freebie trips to the Games. But the culture committee chairman, John Whittingdale, gave BT permission to offer the hottest tickets in town – worth £420 each – to his members because they have been scrutinising the Games for five years. Gold dust: Culture committee chairman John Whittingdale (left) gave BT permission to give away the coveted tickets while Tory MP Philip Davies (right) admitted to accepting one . BT confirmed last night that four of the 11 MPs on the committee have so far accepted seats. The news came as it was revealed the military is to provide up to 3,500 extra personnel for the Games after a private firm admitted it could not supply enough guards to protect the public. Last night critics said the MPs’ decision to take up BT’s offer represented a conflict of interest, since the committee is a watchdog over telecoms issues. BT has also made a multi-million pound move into the sports rights market winning the right to screen Premier League football for the first time. The MPs’ decision to accept free tickets will enrage the millions of people who have found it impossible to get any Olympic seats at all. Fury: Sir Alistair Graham, the former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, condemned the decision . BT are keen to stress that they are not laying on a lavish hospitality package around the 100m final on August 5, like those costing around £7,000 which have been offered on the open market. But the MPs will be taken to the BT Tower in London where they will attend a briefing on the company’s role in the Games before being ferried to the Olympic Stadium where they will watch the race. Yesterday Tory MP Mr Whittingdale defended his right to a free seat at the 100m final. He said: ‘BT are having a briefing on their involvement in the Olympics. My committee has spent five years having regular sessions on the preparations for the Olympics. It’s not terribly surprising that we might have wanted to go and have a look. ‘This is not the first time I’ve been to events with BT or companies that operate in the area that we scrutinise. But they are a major sponsor of the Olympics and have put a huge amount of money into the Games. ‘It would be utterly extraordinary if we didn’t take a look at the Games. I don’t see that this compromises the committee at all.’ He admitted he is also attending Olympic events with the organising committee Locog and other events on behalf of the Government. But he admitted the tickets to the star event of the entire games was ‘a great invitation’ and added: ‘Of course I want to go to the 100m men’s final. It’s one of the most exciting events.’ He also conceded the tickets ‘might encourage people to attend the BT briefing’. Tory MP Philip Davies also admitted that he has accepted a ticket to the 100m and said: ‘Somebody invited us to go along. We’ve been scrutinising the Olympics for ages. I don’t see why we shouldn’t go along and have a look at the Games.’ Olympic stadium: Thousands of fans were not able to get tickets to the Games . Main event: Jamaica's Usain Bolt (R) wins the men's 100m final at the National stadium as part of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games . But a Cabinet Office note circulated to ministers told them: ‘The presumption for all invitations should be that they are declined. Should you feel there is an exceptional case to justify attendance it will need to be supported by a business case and to come to the Cabinet Office for approval.’ Sir Alistair Graham, the former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, condemned the decision of the MPs to accept, pointing out that the MPs will not have to declare the tickets on the Register of Members Interests until three months after the Games. Four members of the culture media and sport select committee have accepted the prized seats from BT, one of London 2012¿s leading sponsors . He said: ‘I am sure most people would be appalled that MPs are being given special treatment when the rest of the population have had to go through all sorts of hoops to get a volleyball ticket. ‘It is appalling that they can accept these tickets and they don’t have to declare them until after the Olympics are over. If people are accepting offers of this sort they should declare them immediately and let their constituents make a judgment about whether they are appropriate or not.’ Tamasin Cave, of the pressure group SpinWatch, said: ‘You can understand why MPs would jump at these tickets, but to accept them shows very poor judgment. These tickets are like gold dust – thousands applied for them. ‘Corporate hospitality as a lobbying tactic runs through our politics. This raises the question of what BT hopes to get in return. It looks very much like they are trying to curry favour with a group of MPs whose job it is to monitor its industry.’ Former MP and anti-sleaze campaigner Martin Bell said: ‘If I were an honourable member and the public are paying hundreds of pounds for tickets I would wonder why MPs get to go for free and what was expected in return. ‘MPs have to be very careful about conflicts of interest and the appearance of conflicts of interest.’ Several members of the culture committee, which has shot to prominence as a result of its role investigating the News of the World phone hacking scandal, have turned down the tickets on the grounds that they don’t think the offer is appropriate. Doing the right thing: Labour MP Tom Watson decided not to take a ticket while Tory Louise Mensch said she had considered taking the ticket before declining . Labour’s Tom Watson, the most . high-profile member of the committee, told the Mail: ‘I’ve taken a . personal decision not to accept freebies. This is the sports committee . and if any section of Parliament is going, it should be them. But on a . personal level I applied for tickets and couldn’t get any and I’d feel a . bit uncomfortable doing it this way.’ At least two other members of the committee, former Labour sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe and Lib Dem Adrian Sanders, will not attend the 100m final, but are likely to see some of the events since they are Olympic ambassadors charged with accompanying foreign dignitaries to events. Fellow Tory Louise Mensch said she had considered taking the ticket before declining. She said: ‘I have turned it down but I’m glad John Whittingdale is going to see how they handle the flagship event as he has been supervising our inquiry for years. I don’t need to see it myself but I am happy to delegate.’ Labour MPs Paul Farrelly and Jim Sheridan said they had also not taken tickets from BT. The remaining committee members – Tories Therese Coffey, Damian Collins and Labour MP Steve Rotherham – all failed to return calls, though it is thought that two of them have accepted tickets. A spokesman for BT said: ‘The cross party committee have a remit that covers the Olympics and so as a major sponsor we feel it is appropriate to brief them on BT’s role in helping to deliver the Games as well as the impact for the legacy programme and local regeneration. The briefing concludes with our hosting them at the stadium. ‘Four members of the committee have accepted to date and the cost to BT is under £500 per guest. ‘The vast majority of the tickets we have bought are going to our retail customers through our Record Breakers promotion or our employees for reward and recognition.’ An amendment has been made to this article since publication after Jim Sheridan MP contacted us.  He wished to confirm that whilst he was offered Olympic tickets, he did not accept the offer."}
{"prompt": "Great Britain's European 100 metres champion James Dasaolu insists athletes can not afford to be distracted by the doping allegations engulfing their sport. A programme broadcast by German TV station ARD revealed allegations of systematic doping and cover-ups in Russia and it was announced on Tuesday that Dick Pound, the hard-hitting former president of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), would head an independent three-man commission investigating the damaging claims. Dasaolu's event has been tainted by doping, with the fastest man in the world in 2014, Justin Gatlin, a two-time drug cheat. Tyson Gay, the second fastest man in history, returned to the track this summer after a reduced one-year suspension, while former world record holder Asafa Powell also came back to competition after his enforced absence for testing positive for a banned stimulant. James Dasaolu hopes British athletes cannot afford to be distracted by doping allegations . On Gatlin, Dasaolu said: 'The sport has allowed him back in, he's served his time and he's come back. All you can do is just get on with it and train and control what you can control as an athlete in your performances. 'I think I raced him once and I think he said, 'good luck' to me or something like that, but apart from that I didn't really converse with him.' Asked about the latest drug scandal to hit the sport, Dasaolu added: 'I'm just an athlete, I just focus on myself, focus on competing, focus on training and that's all we can do as athletes - as opposed to focusing on the politics within the sport. That's a distraction, you can only focus on yourself. 'I'm pretty sure the sport will be cleaned up and all things will be good eventually.' Dasaolu's training partner Asha Philip, one of a crop of exciting young British women sprinters, said: 'If we're worrying if (other competitors) are on drugs, that means they are affecting us, they will be draining our energy and we wouldn't be concentrating on what we came to a championships to do.' Philip has joined Dasaolu's Loughborough-based training group under Steve Fudge and both athletes will compete at the Sainsbury's Indoor Grand Prix in Birmingham in February, with the European Indoor Championships taking place in Prague the following month. Great Britain's Dasaolu wins the men's 100m final during day two of the 2014 European Athletics Championships in Zurich . The Birmingham meeting is the same one at which Dasaolu earlier this year suffered the hamstring injury which ruled him out of the World Indoors and denied him the chance to compete at the Commonwealth Games. But the 27-year-old, whose career has been hampered by injury, said he was not taking a risk with his fitness by doing another indoor season. 'There is no risk at all, I believe I am over my injuries and that's that,' said Dasaolu, who added that a decision had yet to be made over whether he would compete in Prague. '(My fitness) been very consistent this winter, I've had no hiccups.' The Londoner is also hopeful of playing a greater role in the 4x100m relay team next year, having not been part of the quartet which won gold at the European Championships in Zurich in August, despite being the individual 100m champion. Stephen Maguire has replaced Rana Reider in charge of the relay programme. 'I was always involved with the squad, I just unfortunately never got the opportunity to run, but I definitely will be involved with the relay (in 2015),' Dasaolu added. 'As a team, bringing in the additions of myself, I'm sure we'll be able to contend for global medals now.' :: Watch the world's best athletes compete at the Sainsbury's Indoor Grand Prix on Saturday 21 February.

{"prompt": "(CNN) -- Twenty years ago, Edward Djerejian, a former U.S. diplomat, famously worried that Islamists would exploit democratic elections to come to power, after which they would pull the democratic ladder up behind them. Instead of one man, one vote, he said, Islamists wanted one man, one vote, one time. Last week, Egypt's President Mohamed Morsy, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, and his country's first democratically elected president, seemed to fulfill Djerejian's grim prophecy. In a series of unilateral amendments to Egypt's interim constitution, Morsy declared that his word \"is final and binding and cannot be appealed by any way or to any entity,\" and that he is empowered to \"take the necessary actions and measures to protect the country and the goals of the revolution.\" But, as shocking as Morsy's actions are, they do not prove that Islamists cannot be democrats. Morsy's decision to grant himself unquestioned authority was not the final, spectacularly public phase in some hitherto clandestine Muslim Brotherhood plan to erect a holy autocracy. Instead, the Egyptian president simply did what Egyptian presidents have been doing for more than 60 years — that is, loosening institutional restraints on their authority in order to more easily fulfill their agendas. News: Is Morsy Egypt's next strongman? That Morsy is an Islamist is largely irrelevant. It's likely that the autocratic temptation would have seized Egypt's president regardless of his party or ideological orientation. This is not only because Egypt has had a distressingly long history of powerful executives, it's also because, at this moment in Egypt's political history, there is no actor, institution or organization able to keep the presidency in check. Under such circumstances, even the most earnest democrats would find themselves flirting with authoritarianism — first in the name of the greater good, and then later, when pretenses can be dropped, in the service of naked ambition. Usually, presidential ambitions are tamed by legislatures, and this was to be the case under Egypt's interim constitution. A parliament was elected in January, but the Egyptian Supreme Constitutional Court dissolved the body once it became clear that Morsy was on his way to being elected president. The ostensible reason for the dissolution was that the parliamentary election law ran afoul of some foggy constitutional provision, but the real reason was that Islamists dominated parliament, and the court feared that this Islamist legislature, coupled with a Muslim Brotherhood president, would lead Egypt irretrievably down the road to theocracy. In the absence of an elected legislature, it was left to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces -- the consortium of generals who ruled Egypt for the 18 months following former leader Hosni Mubarak's overthrow -- to counteract the presidency. But the Egyptian people and the generals had grown weary of each other. Word in Cairo was that the septuagenarian minister of defense, Muhammad Hussein Tantawi, wanted a way out, a \"safe exit\" in which he could live out his days free of the indignities visited upon his old boss, who bounced between prison and infirmary. A bargain was worked out. The president clawed back the council's powers and sent the minister of defense and the armed forces chief of staff into cossetted retirement (while naming them presidential advisers). The political landscape now lay prostrate before him. Except for the judiciary, and particularly the SCC. To Morsy, the 17 men (and one woman) who make up that body constitute a defiant remnant of the Mubarak order. That a clash was inevitable was apparent from Morsy's first moments in office, when his inauguration was delayed for several hours over his reluctance to be sworn in before the outgoing head of the court. Business: Morsy makes his power plays . When the president decreed that the dissolved parliament should return to work, the judges shut him down. Later, he tried to fire Egypt's attorney general, a Mubarak appointee. Again, he was told that this was outside his ken. Rumors swirled that the SCC was planning to dissolve the second constituent assembly; others reported that a court was about to rule the Muslim Brotherhood itself illegal. Morsy and his men point to these things and argue that he was forced to take action. But what's remarkable is what the president didn't do. For all of his complaining about SCC's dissolution of parliament's lower house, and for all the damage that the decision did to Egypt's democratic transition, the president has indicated that he will uphold it. Essam el-Erian, deputy chairman of the Brotherhood's political arm, the Freedom and Justice Party, has publicly called on Morsy to reinstate the parliament, but a presidential spokesman has said that there are no plans to do so. The president's reluctance to bring back the parliament further reinforces the impression that his main aim is to expand the powers of his office, which he probably believes is better able to put Egypt right than a raucous legislature packed with unreliable Salafists and a fractious \"liberal\" wing. Though the Muslim Brotherhood has generally fallen into line behind the president, there are signs that at least some of its members are deeply uncomfortable with what he has wrought. Muslim Brotherhood politician Ahmed Fahmi, the speaker of the upper house of parliament and a relative of Morsy's, was reported to have said, \"We wish that the president had conducted a popular referendum on the constitutional declaration, because what he has done has divided the country between the secular and Islamic forces.\" (Fahmi has since denied making the statement.) Muhammad Abd al-Quddus, a Muslim Brotherhood member and a member of the board of Egypt's journalists union, reportedly said, \"despite my membership in the Brotherhood, I am a son of the revolution for freedom. Therefore, I reject unlimited powers for the president, regardless of the reasons and the duration.\" Even some of the president's defenders have betrayed hints of ambivalence over his radical decision. Muhammad al-Biltagi, secretary general of the Freedom and Justice Party's Cairo branch, declared that \"many have a right to be worried\" about the president's move to place his decisions above oversight, and he called for a national dialogue to arrive at a solution that would preserve \"the right of the president to perform his duties with full authority without political interference from Mubarak's Constitutional Court, as well as the right of the political and social forces to receive guarantees against even temporary presidential tyranny.\" Today, the only check on Morsy's authority comes from the streets. And while the protests against the president's decisions have been surprisingly robust, Morsy has so far resisted making concessions. In a meeting with Egyptian judges, he reassured them that he would limit his use of his new powers, but, as of this writing, his decree still stands. Though large protests are scheduled, the president may believe that he can afford to wait them out. After all, a repeat of the January 25 scenario is unlikely. The opposition to the president, though significant, remains fractured and uncoordinated, and in any case is far narrower than it was in 2011. The military, which proved essential in removing Mubarak from power, has no appetite for a repeat engagement with the responsibilities of governance, and Morsy has more legitimacy — at home and abroad — than Mubarak did. And Morsy may believe that the great, silent majority of Egyptians are behind him. After all, Egypt's GDP is about an eighth of the United States', and a greater percentage of Americans were literate during the Civil War than Egyptians are today. The vast countryside is likely untroubled by the president's constitutional maneuverings. One might be tempted to ask what the United States, Egypt's greatest foreign patron, can do to set that country on the right course. Some have suggested withholding aid, canceling loans and other means of pressuring Morsy to step back from the authoritarian ledge on which he now finds himself. These measures may produce flurries of positive statements and signals in the near term, but they won't change the fundamental alchemy of Egyptian politics. One only need examine the example of Iraq, which, after almost a decade of American tutelage has nonetheless glided into a form of dominant party autocracy, to realize that genuinely democratic governance cannot be imposed, especially on poor, underdeveloped countries. None of this — Egypt's tradition of executive dominance, its feeble institutions, its weak political organizations or its enervated society — is particularly the fault of the Muslim Brotherhood. In fact, if we are to take any lesson from the turmoil on the banks of the Nile, it is not that Islamists can't be trusted with Egypt's presidency, it is that no one can. Morsy may yet reverse course, but odds are that this will not be the last time that an Egyptian leader tries to convince his people that he must kill democracy in order to save it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tarek Masoud."}

And a young woman said she felt like she'd just consumed something 'very good' for her. Next up Detox - containing 12 melted Creamsicles and 1,200 calories - was put to the test. The slushy mixture certainly got one man fired up for the day and he said he felt like 'going for a jog' after taking a sip.

{"prompt": "(CNN)  -- Husbands are allowed to slap their wives if they spend lavishly, a Saudi judge said recently during a seminar on domestic violence, Saudi media reported Sunday. It is OK to slap Saudi women who spend too much, a judge has told an audience. Arab News, a Saudi English-language daily newspaper based in Riyadh, reported that Judge Hamad Al-Razine said that \"if a person gives SR 1,200 [$320] to his wife and she spends 900 riyals [$240] to purchase an abaya [the black cover that women in Saudi Arabia must wear] from a brand shop and if her husband slaps her on the face as a reaction to her action, she deserves that punishment.\" Women in the audience immediately and loudly protested Al-Razine's statement, and were shocked to learn the remarks came from a judge, the newspaper reported. Arab News reported that Al-Razine made his remark as he was attempting to explain why incidents of domestic violence had increased in Saudi Arabia. He said that women and men shared responsibility, but added that \"nobody puts even a fraction of blame\" on women, the newspaper said. Al-Razine \"also pointed out that women's indecent behavior and use of offensive words against their husbands were some of the reasons for domestic violence in the country,\" it added. Domestic violence, which used to be a taboo subject in the conservative kingdom, has become a hot topic in recent years. Groups like the National Family Safety Program have campaigned to educate the public about the problem and help prevent domestic abuse. Saudi women's rights activist Wajeha Al-Huwaider told CNN that Saudi women routinely face such attitudes. \"This is how men in Saudi Arabia see women,\" she said in a telephone interview from the Saudi city of Dahran. \"It's not something they read in a book or learned from a friend. They've been raised to see women this way, that they're less than a person.\" Al-Huwaider added that \"I'm not surprised to see a judge or a religious man saying that - they've been raised in the same culture - a culture that tells them it's ok to raise your hand to a woman that this works.\" Another Saudi judge, in the city of Onaiza, was the source of a separate recent controversy: he twice denied a request from the mother of an 8-year-old girl that the girl be granted a divorce from her 47-year-old husband. Last month, after human-groups condemned the union, the girl was granted the divorce."}

{"prompt": "Washington (CNN) -- Some may not realize that the modern Republican Party owes its origin to the fight over slavery nearly two centuries ago. In the tumultuous mid-1800s, right before the Civil War, some political activists were concerned about keeping slavery from spreading into new western territories, and they saw no way to stop it through existing political powers: the Democrats and the Whigs (the pro-Congress party of the mid 1800s that largely destroyed itself in the 1852 elections in a battle over slavery). So they formed a new party, taking the name \"Republicans\" in a salute to earlier American politicians. By 1861, they had their first president: Abraham Lincoln. Soon after, slavery fell. The Whig party disappeared. And the Republicans began a long steady rise in power. Even back then, the party liked to talk about fiscal responsibility -- immigration, religion -- and the need for a strong business climate. All of this spurred a sympathetic Chicago newspaper to call the Republicans the Grand Old Party, or the GOP. Republican voters were strongest in rural and western parts of the country, and they were highly successful at maximizing electoral votes to produce presidents: Ulysses S. Grant and Theodore Roosevelt were among their early successes. However, World War I brought sharp policy disagreements to the party. And when Herbert Hoover ushered in the Great Depression, the Republicans were driven into retreat. It would be 20 years until they won the White House again, under Dwight Eisenhower. But since 1969, they have been largely back to their winning ways. During that time, Republicans have been in the Oval Office for almost twice as many years as the Democrats -- Nixon (elected to two terms, but resigned at the start of his second), Ford (served out Nixon's second term), Reagan (elected to two terms), George H.W. Bush (elected to one term) and George W. Bush (elected to two terms). Now Mitt Romney is hoping to restart that tradition."}
{"prompt": "(CNN)  -- The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill student body president who was killed this year was shot several times, including in her head, according to her autopsy report released Monday. Unsealed warrants show Eve Carson was abducted and then shot by both men. Eve Carson, 22, was found slain on March 5. Carson's autopsy report lists six gunshot wounds, but says two were probably from the same bullet, according to North Carolina's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. Carson's death shocked the community and drew national attention. An estimated 10,000 people turned out for a service remembering her. Her autopsy -- released after a North Carolina newspaper filed a court motion to have it unsealed -- describes wounds to various parts of Carson's body. It says shotgun wounds to her head and hand \"most likely represent a single shot with the hand acting as an intermediate target.\" One of the other four wounds was also a gunshot to her head. A separate, handwritten summary of the medical examiner's report says Carson was \"shot multiple times\" and found lying on her back, with one arm bent behind her head. The autopsy says sexual assault testing was done. It does not say whether any sign of sexual assault was found. Two suspects, Demario James Atwater, 22, and Lawrence Alvin Lovette, 17, have been charged with first-degree murder. Lovette's attorney said the warrants against the suspects rely on hearsay. Atwater's attorney cautioned against \"any rush to judgment.\" Court documents released Friday say Carson was kidnapped from her apartment and forced to provide her abductors with ATM access to her bank account before she was shot to death in the early hours of March 5. The documents -- applications for search warrants -- say a confidential informant told police in the days after the death that Atwater had told her he and Lovette had entered Carson's home through an open door and forced Carson to accompany them in her car. The informant said she had talked with Atwater after a picture was displayed on television showing someone attempting to use Carson's ATM card at a convenience store two days after Carson's body was found. The informant said the two men drove Carson to an ATM, obtaining her PIN number from her. \"The CW [informant] learned that Carson was forced into the back seat with Atwater, and Lovette drove Carson's vehicle,\" the court documents said. \"That information is consistent with video footage taken from an ATM camera on that date.\" The witness told police Atwater said the two got about $1,400 from Carson's account. Bank records show that was approximately the amount taken from the account over a two-day period, the documents said. And the informant said that both suspects shot Carson, according to one of the affidavits. \"This information was corroborated by crime scene search information that two separate weapons were used in the homicide,\" the documents said. The documents said police believe Carson was subjected to a sexual assault \"of an unknown nature\" and asked for a search warrant to collect DNA swabs from the suspects. But Orange County, North Carolina, District Attorney Jim Woodall told CNN Friday the collection and testing done on Carson's body was routine, and authorities do not believe she was sexually assaulted. Prosecutors had fought to keep her autopsy sealed. Following a motion by the Raleigh News & Observer newspaper, prosecutors agreed to allow the report's release. Carson, a native of Athens, Georgia, was a pre-medicine student double-majoring in political science and biology. She was a recipient of the university's prestigious Morehead Scholarship and a member of the Phi Beta Kappa honor society, UNC has said."}
{"prompt": "Nazi hunters in Germany are on the trail of 17 more former S.S. guards who worked at the death camp of Majdanek in occupied Poland during the Second World War. Four women are among the suspects said to have helped herd innocent victims into the gas chambers - or who were part of mass shooting parties - which claimed the lives of between 80,000 and 150,000 people, most of them Jews. Majdanek was a hybrid facility which also served as a concentration camp and a source of slave labour. Majdanek (above and below) was a hybrid facility which also served as a concentration camp and a source of slave labour . Located on the outskirts of Lublin in eastern Poland, it was liberated by the Red Army in July 1944 and remains the best preserved Holocaust site with intact gas chambers and crematoria. Germany’s Central Investigation Agency for Nazi War Crimes recently tracked down several Auschwitz camp guards in the country and handed files over to various regional prosecutors who are now mulling charges against them. Auschwitz was first constructed to hold Polish political prisoners, who began to arrive in May 1940. The first extermination of prisoners took place in September 1941 . Kurt Schrimm, the director of the agency based in Ludwigsburg, wants to level charges of complicity in mass murder against the Majdanek guards. Files on three of the suspects have already been handed to prosecutors with Schrimm admitting: 'The evidence is somewhat problematical.' By that he means that there remain no witnesses alive able to testify to the alleged crimes committed by the guards. But he hopes that the case of John Demjanjuk will serve as the blueprint in any forthcoming trials. Demjanjuk was convicted of assisting in the mass murder of 28,000 Jews at the extermination camp of Sobibor, where 250,000 of the six million victims of the Holocaust were murdered. John Demjanjuk (in the wheelchair) was convicted of war crimes without any evidence or testimony against him. Judges decided that it was enough that he had served as a guard at Sobibor concentration camp. He died on March 17, 2012 . He was convicted in Munich in 2011 without a shred of testimony about what he did in the camp: judges ruled for the first time that it was enough for him to have have served there for him to be guilty of aiding the Nazis in their criminal enterprise. Schrimm went on: 'Majdanek is a very complicated camp and for us because there were no demarcated areas for the killings as in other Nazi camps.' Indeed research is continuing at the site of the camp - now a memorial and museum - to try to ascertain the correct numbers of those murdered there. 'We have little material, the information we have is not optimal,' admitted Schrimm,. Age and infirmity could mean that some, perhaps all, of the S.S.killers from Majdanek will not be brought to trial. Of the recent Auschwitz suspects rounded up with the help of the Nazi hunters of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre in Israel, nine have been judged incapable of standing trial, four were let go because of lack of evidence, four more have since died, one was released because he had already served time for war crimes in Poland and 14 more cases are still being considered by public prosecutors across Germany."}
{"prompt": "By . Rachel Quigley . PUBLISHED: . 15:56 EST, 1 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:33 EST, 1 November 2012 . Suspicions: Head football coach Todd Hoffner, 46, was arrested on allegations that he had possessed and produced child pornography . A university football coach facing child pornography charges took the stand yesterday and vehemently denied that cellphone videos he shot of his naked children in the summer were 'inappropriate' and said they were just family fun. Speaking publicly for the first time since his August arrest, Minnesota State University, Mankato coach Todd Hoffner, 46, asked a Blue Earth County district judge to dismiss the charges, arguing that he should have never been arrested. 'There was nothing inappropriate about any of these videos,' he said of footage a technician found on his school-issued cellphone when he took it to the campus IT department after it malfunctioned. The three videos showed his children - aged five to nine years old - dancing around naked and touching their private parts. The coach's testimony came near the end of a three-hour hearing in which his attorney, Jim Fleming, pressed investigators about whether they thought the videos were, in fact, pornographic when they first saw them. Some said they found the images 'disturbing' while others said they needed more context, according to the Star Tribune. Both Fleming and Hoffner's wife have publicly rejected the charges as ridiculous, saying the videos simply captured the family's children being silly. A search of computers taken from the Hoffner home has found 'no additional items that would be considered child pornography,' said Blue Earth County Sheriff's Captain Rich Murry. Hoffner was charged last month with one count of using minors in a sexual performance or pornographic work and one count of possessing child pornography. Both are felonies. He has been the university's head football coach since 2008. Prosecutor Michael Hanson - who was the one to cast the final decision that the images were pornographic and an arrest had to be made - said on Wednesday: 'Adults should not make videos of children in lewd poses -- period.' Search: No child porn was found on the computers taken from the Hoffner family home . Hoffner spoke to the court yesterday to explain the events surrounding the three videos. Two of them - which prosecutors said are the most troubling - show his children fooling around after a whirlpool bubble bath. They drop their towels and run around naked. At one point, the eight-year-old son grabs his genitals and his daughters bend over and spread their buttocks apart. These were shot in June. Hoffner told the court, that after their bath, the children came down to where he was working and asked their father to videotape them because they had made up  skit and wanted their dad to record it - which he did on the work Blackberry, according to the Star Tribune. 'It started with their towels on,' he said. 'They were singing, dancing and laughing. They were doing silly things, having fun.' He said his son seemed determined to 'sabotage' his sisters' routine and jumped in front of them and 'grabbed his private parts' for a few seconds. Controversy: Hoffner was arrested and escorted off a football practice field in August, he remains on leave pending a university investigation . He said he stopped recording at this point but then his daughters, who were upset with their brother, asked them to record it again. This time, the son ran in naked with just a football helmet on. Hoffner said at this point he stopped recording as he knew his son was determined to 'mess everything up'. In an August video, one of the coach's daughters is woken up by her father and told to go to the bathroom. As she is followed to the bathroom, the camera is focused on her underwear. He said he did not show the videos to anyone and did not even view them again after taking them. In fact, he forgot they were even on there when he took his phone to the university's IT department, he told the court. Support: Hoffman's wife Melodee has publicly rejected the charges as ridiculous saying that her husband is innocent and charges against him are 'ridiculous and baseless' But Hanson said it is for this very reason that charges should be withheld. He said: 'You typically have videos made to show to your friends or put on Facebook. That didn't happen here and it didn't happen for a pretty good reason.' Hoffner said he was genuinely shocked when he was arrested on the pornography charges and he had no idea what videos they were talking about. A search of computers and other equipment taken from Hoffner's home when he was arrested turned up no evidence to support the prosecution's case. Social workers who interviewed the children and saw the videos said they found no evidence the couple's children had been abused. Coach Todd Hoffner's attorney Jim Fleming speaks to the media .

The France forward, who scored Chelsea’s opener in the 13th minute against Maribor in their 6-0 Champions League victory at Stamford Bridge, limped off immediately after his goal. Blues boss Jose Mourinho, who is already without Diego Costa for Sunday’s trip to Manchester United in the Barclays Premier League, claims Remy has no chance. Loic Remy put Chelsea ahead after 13 minutes after cutting in from the right hand side and firing home . As his Chelsea team-mates celebrated, Remy was left clutching at his troublesome groin, and was replaced . Remy's injury could pose a serious problem for Chelsea, who go to Manchester United next week . Didier Drogba, who came on to score his first goal for Chelsea since returning to the club, could start at Old Trafford if both strikers are ruled out. Mourinho said: ‘Remy has a muscular injury. I don't know the dimension and I'm not worried. When a player is injured, play another one. ‘I don't expect him to play. I don't like to speak about injured players. ‘Tomorrow is our day off and the doctor is forbidden to call me to speak about injuries. I don't want to speak about injuries, Man United. I don't want to know. Remy stretches for the ball inside the Maribor box, and the striker picked up an injury early on . Didier Drogba scored his first goal for Chelsea since his return to Stamford Bridge from the penalty spot . ‘I cannot speak about Man United. I can speak about ourselves. We are playing well, we are getting good results. We don't cry on injuries. It's our philosophy, we don't cry. ‘We just think one injury means an opportunity for somebody else. We cannot hide. In this moment we have some problems with players that are not available to play. ‘We will prepare the game Thursday, Friday, Saturday to try to be at our best possible level against an opponent which we respect very, very much.’ Drogba could make a shock start if Costa and Remy fail to recover in time to face United. He scored a penalty in the 23rd minute after asking permission from regular taker Eden Hazard for the honour. Mourinho added: ‘I don’t like it, but if they ask to do it then they have to score. Kurt Zouma impressed on his Champions League debut in a game where Chelsea were rarely troubled . Mourinho insisted that Zouma is 'ready to play any match' and compared him to France star Raphael Varane . ‘I was not expecting Didier to play 75 (minutes). I spoke with him yesterday and we spoke about 30. It was circumstances. He had to go on. ‘He was comfortable to play 75 minutes. It was very, very important for Didier. The best thing for a player to improve his condition is to play. ‘His last goal for Chelsea was the most important goal in the history of the club.’ Mourinho also had kind words for central defender Kurt Zouma, and claims the youngster is ready to challenge for a first team place after making his Champions League bow on Tuesday. Zouma, who started his first Chelsea game in the Capital One Cup tie against Bolton, played the 6-0 win over Maribor in place of Gary Chaill. Mourinho said: ‘It's always better to play them when the situation is good. Zouma is in a different dimension. ‘Zouma is ready to play any match, but because I wanted to give stability to the team I played since day one with Cahill and John. ‘It is a similar situation to the one I had at Real Madrid with Raphael Varane.’ Jose Mourinho had the opportunity to introduce some of his younger squad players, including Nathan Ake . He also backed Nathan Ake, who came on as a substitute last night, and Dominic Solanke to become first team regulars at Chelsea. Mourinho added: ‘Ake's a different level, but is in the level of the almost there. ‘Solanke is in the phase of the talent that we know that is there, but is far from being there. For him it was also a perfect situation. ‘Something he never forgets and for sure he's going to play many, many Champions League matches, because he'll be a very good player.’ VIDEO We are playing with confidence - Mourinho ."}
{"prompt": "Tokyo (CNN) -- Radioactive cesium has been found in baby formula in Japan following the nuclear crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, the manufacturer of the product has said. Meiji Co., the maker of the formula, said Tuesday that it had found traces of cesium 134 and cesium 137 in samples of its Step Milk powder with the expiration date of Oct. 2012, but that the levels would not be harmful to babies' health. The formula contained as much as 31 becquerels of cesium per kilogram, below the allowable limit of 200 becquerels per kilogram set by the government, Meiji said. A becquerel is a measurement of radioactive intensity. A spokesman for Meiji said the company would nonetheless offer free replacements of 400,000 cans of the product \"to relieve the anxieties of our customers.\" Ingredients of the baby powder may have come into contact with airborne radioactive cesium when they were being dried at a factory in Kasukabe, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of Tokyo, between March 14 and 20, the company said. The devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck the northeast coast of Japan on March 11 damaged nuclear reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, resulting in radiation leaks. Meiji accounts for about 40 percent of baby formula sales in Japan. It also exports the Step Milk formula to Vietnam under a different name, but says it examines the product before shipping.

{"prompt": "Gleneagles, Scotland (CNN) -- European momentum endures at the Ryder Cup, despite a brief reality check. Two years on from the \"Miracle of Medinah\", those in blue responded to an early blow from its American opponent to end a breathless day in prime position. As the sun dipped below the Ochil Hills in Scotland, Europe carved out a 5-3 advantage, roaring back in an afternoon session that spoke of the continent's deep reserves. That the pairing of world No. 1 Rory McIlroy and No. 3 Sergio Garcia scrambled desperately to grab a tie in their afternoon match, having lost in the morning, underlines the point. New heroes were born — rookies Victor Dubuisson and Jamie Donaldson among them — as familiar fault lines in American ranks were exposed once more. It was actually the first pairs session victory Europe had enjoyed since 2010, and the best foursomes win in their history, after the U.S. had secured a morning lead of 2½ - 1½. No wonder European captain Paul McGinley ended the day displaying that trademark grin of his. \"Today shows how important momentum switches are and how it can have a domino effect. For our guys to respond as well as they did shows a real strength of character,\" McGinley told reporters. \"For me it's not about two points dropped if (McIlroy and Garcia) lost, but they went out this afternoon and rectified this morning -- it was probably as good as a win from where they were. \"It's not a perfect science, but two out of three rookies (winning) isn't bad. The afternoon rookies had great partners in Lee Westwood and Graeme McDowell — there aren't better guys on your shoulders in a Ryder Cup. \"It's a great day but let's take stock — we have a big day tomorrow.\" Europe fly in foursomes . Not a single slice of red could be seen at the conclusion of the afternoon matches, which will no doubt cause McGinley's counterpart Tom Watson a bout of introspection. In the morning, the rookie pairing of Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed had shot down Ian Poulter, nicknamed Europe's postman because he always delivers. Yet after comfortably disposing of Poulter and Scotland's Stephen Gallacher the American pair were rested for the foursomes contests -- Watson later conceded the error of judgment. Meanwhile Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley showed signs of fatigue as they surrendered their 100% record as a pairing to Graeme McDowell and European rookie Victor Dubuission -- they had earlier dispatched Europe's gun pairing of McIlroy and Garcia. The one afternoon match that had seemed a U.S. banker was the one that pitted rookie Jimmy Walker and world No. 10 Rickie Fowler against that gun pairing. Two up with three to play, and with the European pair hell bent on redemption, the American's conservatism when trying to close out the match opened the door. McIlroy birdied 17 before an arrowing second into the 18th from Garcia put pressure on Walker to hole a final putt to win the match. He couldn't, and their opponents could breathe a sigh of relief. \"We owed each other a lot,\" Garcia told reporters. \"We knew we weren't playing great but fought as hard as we could and half a point is huge.\" Fulsome support . The day had begun in darkness, spectators dashing through the gates at 6am, desperate to secure a seat in the grandstand around the first tee. By quarter past there wasn't a spare seat to be had, by half past the 2,500 strong gallery were in full voice and by the time the captains arrived on the tee, excitement was palpable. Former U.S. Open champion Justin Rose and Sweden's Henrik Stenson lapped up the acclaim as they made the long walk from the range to the tee, through a tunnel bedecked with images of Ryder Cup legends gone by. The honor of hitting the first ball of the 40th instalment of the Ryder Cup fell to another ex-U.S. Open champion, Webb Simpson, who mishit his shot, before Bubba Watson again encouraged ear-splitting noise from the crowd as he crunched a drive into the rough. The European pairing were less wayward but after a halved first hole they grabbed the initiative on the second hole and didn't let go. Stenson, the 2013 FedEx Cup winner, proved the difference on the second hole, Rose the difference on the fourth — a rapier-like approach yielding another birdie. Two more birdies, on nine and 10, took the match out of Watson and Simpson's reach, the first point of Scotland's Ryder Cup secured with another birdie on the 14th. American fightback . It didn't take long for the U.S. to respond. Poulter's \"postman\" tag preceded him on the tee. But the rookie pairing of Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed paid no heed to the Englishman's reputation. Despite earning the loudest cheers thanks to the presence of Scotland's own Stephen Gallacher, Poulter and partner fell behind on the first and failed to rally. A stretch of five birdies in six holes chipped away ever so slightly at Poulter's mantle, Gallacher perhaps overcome by nerves on his own Ryder cup debut. A victory, secured by the same 5&4 margin Rose and Stenson had managed, answered that early European pressure. Behind them McIlroy and Garcia were locked in a ding-dong battle with Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley, who put their unbeaten Ryder Cup record on the line. Having lobbied McGinley for months to play together, McIlroy and Garcia prised out a one-hole lead after the Spaniard chipped in on four. But by the 10th, Mickelson and Bradley had established a two-hole lead, erased by European birdies on 11 and 13. Another McIlroy birdie on 15 titled the balance towards the blue half but Bradley's brilliant eagle on 16 ensured they would go up the last all flat. None of the four played it spectacularly, but it all came down to the match's final blow, which Mickelson duly dispatched to maintain that winning streak for a few hours at least.

For a long while it looked like Europe would also be able to boast two points after the morning session as U.S. Open champion Martin Kaymer, from Germany, and Denmark's Thomas Bjorn raced into a three-hole lead. But Rickie Fowler and his partner Jimmy Walker hung in, and despite going two down on the 13th, the latter — a rookie — showed firm resolve to sink a birdie putt on the last and secured a vital half. Two of the afternoon's foursomes matches, where players take alternate shots, were on the course before McIlroy and Garcia had finished their morning round. First out were a group that had all missed the morning session, England's Lee Westwood — playing in his eighth Ryder Cup — alongside rookie Jamie Donaldson, Matt Kuchar joining Jim Furyk. The U.S. were ahead after the third, but fell two behind on the 11th as Donaldson warmed to his task. The deficit was reduced on 16, but after Kuchar fluffed a chip on the last, Europe secured a two up victory. Behind them Rose and Stenson picked up where they left off in the morning, going two up after six holes on Zach Johnson and Hunter Mahan, both fresh after a morning rest. Despite twice being pegged back to all square, Rose was equal to the test, his putting stroke proving the difference on 15 and 17 as a 2&1 victory made it a two-point day for the pair. The last match out saw another test of Mickleson and Bradley's 100% record, with French rookie Dubuisson and McDowell accepting the challenge. McDowell, playing for the first time in the competition without fellow Northern Irishman McIlroy by his side, played big brother to the 24-year-old as they charged into a three-hole lead. Despite having their lead dented twice, once on the front nine and once on the back, they scampered to the finish line to secure a 3&2 win and a near-perfect European afternoon. McDowell, himself a U.S. Open champion, ended the day by saying of his partner: \"This guy is going to be the next superstar of European golf, I'm telling you.\" As the sun set on an absorbing first day, the pairings for Saturday's morning fourballs were announced. Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson will be off first again, playing Bubba Watson and Matt Kuchar. Lee Westwood and Jamie Donaldson are out second playing Jim Furyk and Hunter Mahan.

Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata and Robin van Persie inflicted Liverpool’s seventh defeat of the Barclays Premier League season to move within five points of Manchester City in second. Rodgers, who faces a tricky Capital One Cup quarter-final at Bournemouth on Wednesday, is struggling to find solutions after this latest defeat. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers looks down after his side's 3-0 defeat at Old Trafford . Raheem Sterling shows frustration after another missed opportunity during the difficult defeat . The Liverpool manager said: ‘We have to recapture the team ethos. With the emphasis of the team, it is clear to me that we are searching to find solutions. ‘The players are working hard, the players have given everything, they are pressing and they are working. ‘In every dressing room there have always been been issues, but it is not something I discuss outside of the dressing room. The players are honest but we are not getting results. Rodgers says his players are honest, and will keep working hard to get results as the season goes on . Rodgers, who chose to field Sterling as his central striker, admitted there is tension in the dressing room . ‘I can’t fault the commitment of the players because they gave everything.’ Rodgers axed Belgian keeper Simon Mignolet and replaced him with Brad Jones for the trip to Old Trafford and also changed to a 3-4-3 system. It played straight into United’s hands and Louis van Gaal’s team, who have now won six games in a row, were 2-0 up at the break. Rodgers added: ‘Simon has been fine, I spoke to him after the Basle game in the Champions League and he understood it. 'Brad Jones didn’t have much to do and he’s ending up picking the ball out of the net three times. Brad Jones, who replaced Simon Mignolet in the Liverpool goal, had no chance with Juan Mata's header . Rodgers was upset with the second goal, which was clearly some way offside, but missed by the linesman . Rodgers pointed to David de Gea's excellent performance as one of the reasons for his side's defeat . ‘This will be for an indefinite period. In my first year Brad did well and sometimes coming out of the firing line can help. ‘I just felt after Basle game that there was a chance to make the decision.’ Rooney scored United’s first goal but their next, scored by Mata, should have been disallowed for offside. Van Persie wrapped it up for United after the break with a clinical strike. Despite the emphatic scoreline, United keeper David de Gea was man of the match for a string of excellent saves from Mario Balotelli and Raheem Sterling. Rodgers added: ‘We didn’t deserve to lose, but we need to be more clinical. ‘Their keeper got man of the match and that tells you everything. We created more chances against United than in the last five or six games but we are disappointed with the first and the third goal. ‘The second one was clearly offside. With the players we had we did the best we could.’ Van Gaal’s side are eight points behind Chelsea and are in third position in the Premier League after this convincing victory. Mario Balotelli and Sterling cut dejected figures as they get ready to kick-off after conceding at Old Trafford . David de Gea celebrates Rooney's goal moments after making the save from Sterling's point blank strike . The Manchester United keeper was man of the match, denying Liverpool with several superb saves . Balotelli came on as a second half substitute but failed to find the net again for the Reds . Despite their good form the Dutch coach refuses to accept that his team can challenge for the title in his first season in England. He added: ‘The most important match is always the next one. We are winning now, six matches in a row but we have to improve our style. ‘We can kill the game easily, but we must improve. Everyone is happy now - my cook is happy and my wife is happy because we beat Liverpool. ‘We have a way of playing that takes into account the qualities of the opponent and my staff are always looking for the way we can inflict pain on the opponent. Despite the comfortable victory, their sixth in a row, Louis van Gaal admitted United have to improve . VIDEO Van Gaal not concerned with title talk . ‘You need luck, but you can force the luck. That was not the case at the start of the season.’ Van Persie added: ‘The fans were absolutely brilliant from the start to the finish. They were our 12th man again. David was outstanding again. He was absolutely brilliant like he always is.’ United are dealing with another injury after Marcos Rojo pulled out on Saturday. Van Gaal refused to discuss the extent of the problem.

'Repugnant': Andrew Gwndaf Jones, 44, was jailed for perverting the course of justice . A shoplifter who lied about his daughter being killed in a car smash and said he needed bail to attend the funeral has been jailed for perverting the course of justice. Andrew Gwyndaf Jones made up the horrendous tale when he appeared before magistrates in July this year facing four charges of theft. The 44-year-old, who had more than 120 previous offences, was set to be remanded in custody after his hearing was adjourned for a week. But he pleaded with the District Judge who was presiding over the case, saying his daughter had been killed in an accident and that he would miss her funeral if he was not granted bail. Judge Andrew Shaw agreed to turn Jones loose so that he could be at the service, but his lies were exposed after the girl's mother read a report of proceedings in the local press. After he had been bailed, friends and relatives of the young girl even began contacting her mother with messages of condolence. The furious mother contacted police, telling them that her daughter was alive and well and that Jones had made up the story to secure bail. When approached by officers, the thief said his bail application was in relation to another daughter and then a step-daughter. All his claims proved to be lies. Having been hauled back before the judge, Jones, of no fixed abode, was jailed for six months for the four shoplifting charges. He was then charged with perverting the course of justice in relation to the bogus bail submission. Jailed: Jones was sentenced at Mold Crown Court, above, after the mother of his child told police he had lied about the accident . After pleading guilty at that hearing at Mold Crown Court, Judge Niclas Parry said: 'It is difficult to imagine how anyone could stoop so low.' Jailing Jones for a further 10 months, the judge said the lie was 'as repugnant as it was serious' and 'struck at the heart of the administration of justice'. Clare Jones, defending, said that her client had a 26-year drug addiction but was motivated to change and was now providing negative drug tests. He had been supported by Narcotics Anonymous and since August had been able to put drugs behind him."}
{"prompt": "By . Eleanor Harding . Author Helen Fielding admitted that she suffered many of the same misfortunes as her creation Bridget Jones . She created one of one of the most calamity-hit heroines of contemporary fiction. Now Helen Fielding has revealed that she is more like Bridget Jones than she would care to admit, and is constantly getting herself into embarrassing scrapes. Whether it’s melting her kettle, sending round-robin emails by mistake or accidentally stealing petrol, the author admitted her day-to-day life is not too dissimilar to that of her scatter-brained heroine. Speaking at the Hay Festival in Wales yesterday, Fielding, 56, said ‘things seem to happen’ to her despite being a world-famous novelist. She said: ‘I have always denied it but think actually maybe there are some things in common.’ She recounted one incident in which she received a call from her agent saying that a policeman had called and asked if she was the owner of a Peugeot 308. ‘It turns out that I had driven away from a petrol station without paying for the petrol,’ she said. ‘There was some criminal charge going on.’ In another, she accidentally left a kettle on a hob and came back to find it melting and giving off ‘acrid smoke’. She said although she was ‘very disorganised’, she kept a file of the messes she had got herself into which could provide inspiration for her novels. She said: ‘It started when I had my daughter, and I was having her via C-section. So I decided to do a birth announcement, saying what she was going to be called, when she was going to be born and so on. ‘So I prepared this email to send to everyone before I went into hospital. But then I accidentally pressed “send all”. ‘So then I had to then say, “sorry, I haven’t actually had the baby.” So then when I did have the baby I thought, “I can’t send another one.” It all got into a terrible mess.’ Ms Fielding has written three novels featuring Bridget Jones who was played by Texan actress Renee Zellweger, pictured . She also admitted that, like her heroine Bridget, who is always chopping and changing outfits, she worried what to wear for to speak for the event. ‘I worried a lot about whether it was OK to wear these boots,’ she said. ‘I was infected with the concept of effortless festival chic. This morning I was very confused about what to wear.’ Fielding, whose novel Bridget Jones's Diary and the sequel Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason were published in the 1990s, said she hoped the stories had helped single women feel more comfortable about themselves. The books, which were both made into films starring Renée Zellweger and Colin Firth, tell the story of a single girl in her 30s and her quest for happiness in love, life and work. She hit out at the idea that when a woman comes ‘of a certain age’ they were expected to ‘fade away and say, “never mind me”.’ ‘The truth is, that we do not actually really change,’ she said. ‘That mentalness and that sense of hope and joy and the ability to be childish and  be silly and keep exploring life and keep having adventures and keep having sex and keep seeing what’s round the corner is part of being a person, a woman.’ She added: ‘Life is for living. We live longer, and especially women, we should carry on and give ourselves a new identity. Especially thirty-something women, don’t think of themselves as tragic barren spinsters now. They are not Miss Haversham.’ She also lamented the fact that societal expectations were so high for women to be perfect in every aspect of their lives. She said: ‘The bar now is so high in terms of what we’re supposed to be like. In terms of what we’re supposed to look like, what we’re supposed to wear, what we’re supposed to be like as parents, and what we are supposed to have achieved professionally.’ ‘I think it’s huge and it’s really sad. If Bridget has done anything to change that, and make people think it’s alright to muck up, it’s alright not to be perfect, it’s alright to be fat, it’s alright to sometimes say the wrong thing, as long as you’re kind and you can laugh along with your friends.’ She said that the problem was so ingrained that it was filtering down to children. She added: ‘I’ve yet to meet a woman who does not obsess about her weight. There might be some, but I think we’ve looked at too many airbrushed pictures. ‘With the children aged seven saying “I’m fat,”, it’s really difficult.’ Fielding, from West Yorkshire, started her career as a newspaper journalist and Bridget Jones's Diary began its life as an anonymous column in The Independent in 1995. Her latest novel, Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, tells the story of Bridget as an older woman who is widowed and decides to get on the dating scene again. Fielding said she thought most people were meeting online now rather than in person, adding: ‘It’s no longer a sign of desperation.’"}

{"prompt": "By . Sarah Griffiths . A study has claims that honeybees (pictured) rely on a built in 'sat-nav' system to find their way home . It has been claimed that bees solve difficult maths problems and that their tiny brains are better than computers. And now a new study suggests that the insects rely on a built in ‘sat nav’ system to find their way around. Honeybees make ‘mental maps’ of their home ranges allowing them to pinpoint destinations miles away from their hives. While humans, sharks and even pigeons are known to use this technique, it was popularly thought that bees rely solely on the sun’s position to find their way back to their hive. Dr James Cheeseman of Auckland University in New Zealand, said: ‘Only 50 years ago the claim any non-human animal had a cognitive map was deeply controversial because it suggested a computational theory of mind. The question of whether insects do is a frontier question.’ To come up with their finding, scientists captured and anaesthetised honeybees and shifted some of their circadian (body) clocks by six hours to disorientate them. They fitted them with tiny radar transponders to track their movements after releasing them in a different location. The researchers reasoned that if the bees did rely on the sun as a compass, then the alteration to their body clocks would disrupt their ability to find their way home. They found that when the bees with . altered body clocks were let out in a field in Brandenburg, Germany, . they returned with similar speed and accuracy as those that had not been . put to sleep, according to the study published in the journal . Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Although Hv1a/GNA was carried to the brain of the honeybee (stock image), it had no effect on the insect, which suggests the highly selective spider venom toxin does not interact with the calcium channels in the bee . Bees can solve complex mathematical problems which keep computers busy for days, a 2010 study showed. The tiny insects learn to fly the shortest possible route between flowers discovered in random order. Effectively, they are capable of solving the 'travelling salesman problem' - unlike any other animal known besides humans, scientists said. The classic conundrum involves finding the shortest route that allows a travelling salesman to call at all the locations he has to visit. Computers solve the problem by comparing the length of all possible routes and choosing the one that is shortest. Bees manage to reach the same solution using a brain the size of a grass seed. Artificial flowers were used to test bee behaviour. The researchers wanted to know whether bees would follow a simple route defined by the order in which they found the flowers, or look for the shortest route. After exploring the location of the flowers, bees quickly learned to fly the best route for saving time and energy. Dr Cheeseman said: ‘The results suggest bees may navigate by a mental terrain map in addition to learned sun-compass directions.’ It is known that mammals can navigate areas by making cognitive maps - a mental representation of landmarks like rocks, trees and rows of bushes. But it was unclear as to whether insects possess the same skill. ‘The results we report imply the bee is like mammals and birds in that its brain constructs an integrated, metric cognitive map,’ he said. The discovery is remarkable because the brain of the bee is tiny and lacks structures such as the hippocampus, which is used in navigation. But the insects must somehow construct a type of map that includes information on directions, distances, diverse landmarks, feeding sources and terrain features to permit the complicated computation of an efficient journey home. In the experiment, when the bees with altered body clocks were released, they returned with similar speed and accuracy as those that had not been put to sleep, suggesting bees may navigate by a mental terrain map in addition to learned sun-compass directions.

'Beep, beep, beep - people hate the sound of them,' admitted Mr Hanson-Abbott, chairman and founder of Brigade Electronics, who gave up his career in shipping in 1976 to concentrate on the devices after spotting a lorry in Japan with a rudimentary reversing alarm. Inventor Chris Hanson-Abbott says people find the sounds vehicles make when . they reverse 'annoying' - and has said he hopes to replace them with a . less abrasive noise . The alarms began to become widespread in the 1980s and have helped save lives thanks to their ear-piercing 'beeps'. But there have been mounting complaints about them. In 2012, there was even a reversing alarm flashpoint in Colne, Lancashire, with residents at loggerheads with a local supermarket. One commentator told the Lancashire Telegraph: '[The residents] have to go work and they are being woken up early and then can't get back to sleep. 'They go to work tired, they come home tired and then it happens all over again. It is horrendous for them.' Yesterday Mr Hanson-Abbott told the BBC: 'The sound tonal alarms make is very annoying', but added that has always been part of the point as they are meant to be heard and not ignored. But he said complaints about them and a growing awareness of noise pollution in general, has got him thinking about alternatives. He hopes the beeps will one day be replaced with single tones with 'broadband' sound, which resembles the crash of an ocean wave, albeit in short, staccato bursts. 'It sounds a lot nicer,' said Mr Hanson-Abbott. He developed the quote broadband sound in 1999 and since then around 3 million supermarket lorries have switched to it.

Owners Christopher Niebel and Gary McNeish were making up to £7,000 a day from selling the details of those who replied to other companies. Other firms sending similar texts or phone messages have been warned they may be next as the ICO is receiving tens of thousands of complaints from the public. Information Commissioner, Christopher Graham, said: 'The public have . told us that they are distressed and annoyed by the constant bombardment . of illegal texts and calls and we are currently cracking down on the . companies responsible, using the full force of the law. 'The two individuals we have served penalties on today made a . substantial profit from the sale of personal information. They knew they . were breaking the law. 'Our message to the public is that if you don’t know who sent you a text . message then do not respond, otherwise your details may be used to . generate profits for these unscrupulous individuals.' Examples of the text messages sent out by Tetrus Telecoms included: 'CLAIM TODAY you may be entitled to £3500 for the accident you had. To . claim free, reply CLAIM to this message. To opt out text STOP. Thank . you'. Another was: 'URGENT! If you took out a Bank Loan prior to 2007 then you . are almost certainly entitled to £2300 in compensation. To claim reply . ‘YES’.' The monster fine came following an 18-month investigation into the activities of Tetrus Telecoms. Money-maker: These companies bombard people with texts and those who reply they then try to extract personal information that can help them make huge profits . The company was sending huge volumes of unsolicited text messages from offices in Stockport and Birmingham, without the consent of the recipient and without identifying the sender - both of which are legal requirements. Any replies were then used to generate leads that were sold to other companies at a considerable profit. The ICO’s investigation included raids at the company’s Stockport premises, in August 2011, and the Manchester home of Niebel, in February this year. Phone owners should also not receive unwanted automated calls - but many companies flout the law and ring them anyway - much to the anger of many . The evidence obtained showed Tetrus was using unregistered pay as you go sim cards to send out as many as 840,000 illegal text messages a day with an income of £7,000 - £8,000 a day. Niebel has now been ordered to pay a penalty of £300,000, while McNeish, who appears to have taken less out of the business, has been fined £140,000. The ICO has connected the company to over 400 complaints to its office about spam texts linked to Tetrus. If you receive a text from a company . you know, or from an anonymous five digit short code, you can prevent . any repeat by replying with the word 'STOP'. If the text message is from an . unknown company, or from an organisation you are not familiar with, the . telecoms watchdog OFCOM recommends that you do not reply. Responding will confirm that the number is active and might result in more messages, or even voice calls. Instead, you should report the text . to your network operator, which may be able to prevent further messages . from the originating number. If the texts continue, complain to . the Information Commissioner's Office – . http://www.ico.gov.uk/complaints.aspx or 0303 123 1113.

The museum already houses a collection of more than 2.5million items, but Canelle will be the star of a large exhibition on bears set to open there this autumn. Francis Duranthon, chief curator of the Museum of Natural History, told La Depeche: 'We are currently finalising the naturalisation of Canelle in our taxidermy laboratory and she will undoubtedly be one of the stars of the show.' The exhibition - called Bears, Myths and Realities - will present the ten bear species that exist on out planet, but will also go deeper to look at the relationship between humans and bears. 'Since ancient times man has carried an ambiguous relationship with the bear, a mythical animal which is both a scary predator and a companion of children,' Mr Duranthon said. 'We will discuss many legends and extraordinary stories like Woyzeck the Bear, mascot of the Polish Army, which fought in the battle of Monte Cassino in 1944 and was even decorated!' Would make a nice rug: To prepare the bears - and any other animal - for display they must first be skinned, which can be done in a manner similar to the way you might skin a chicken before cooking it .

While the preservation of animal skins has been practised almost since the beginning of recorded civilisation, the earliest modern-style techniques were published in the middle of the 18th century in France. It was in the 19th century that hunters began taking their trophies to upholstery shops, where they would have the skins sewn up and stuffed with cotton - a crude form of taxidermy that has given us the term 'stuffed animal'.

These days, however, professional taxidermists prefer the term 'mounting' to 'stuffing', reflecting the effort that goes into the carefully sculpted bodies beneath the skin. As the UK-based Guild of Taxidermist puts it: 'To say that a taxidermist stuffs animals is misleading. In fact the skin is removed, preserved and arranged around a model of the original body. 'A good knowledge of anatomy is essential to create the artificial body or 'form'. Artistic talent is needed to finish the specimen and set up a natural display. 'A good taxidermist is a sculptor, artist and naturalist rolled into one.' Toulouse's museum is billing their exhibition, which will feature bears from across the world, as the event of the year. It will open in October, on the centenary of the invention of the teddy bear."}
{"prompt": "(CNN) -- A third of the houses on Britain's second most expensive street are lying vacant, many abandoned for decades and left to rot. Behind the padlocked gates and long driveways, up to 20 mansions stand empty on London's The Bishops Avenue, despite a reported combined value of around £350 million ($582 million). Dubbed \"Billionaires' Row,\" the road's average house costs over £6 million ($9.98 million), but many have been deserted by their wealthy owners. Despite their dilapidated condition, the houses remain a safe place for wealthy foreigners to park their money because of London's rocketing property prices, which rose 11% last year, and because of the road's reputation as a magnet for the rich and famous. Anil Varma, a property developer appointed by a hedge fund owner to manage six of the vacant homes, calls it one of \"the most expensive wastelands in Europe.\" He's hoping to get permission to convert decaying mansion The Towers into luxury apartments. Bought 25 years ago by a prominent Middle Eastern family but never lived in because of planning permission complications, the once-magnificent mansion was abandoned and has fallen into disrepair. Varma showed CNN through the property, revealing animal skeletons lying on moss-covered floors, paint ripped off the damp-soaked ceilings and stairs which have partially collapsed. Jersey House, 200 meters up the road, is on sale for £40 million ($67 million) and estate agent Trevor Abrahmsohn says investors aren't put off by the numerous abandoned homes on the road because The Bishops Avenue \"is an iconic road, like Rodeo Drive or Wall Street.\" Buying a house here \"is a statement of wealth... a statement that you've arrived,\" he told CNN. The street has long been a landing pad for wealthy investors in developing countries undergoing geopolitical chaos: Iranians after the 1979 revolution, eastern Europeans after the collapse of the Berlin Wall and most recently, Chinese oligarchs, he said. But, as Britain faces a housing shortage and soaring property prices, The Bishops Avenue's empty mansions are likely to add to debate over taxes payable by overseas property buyers -- particularly if they remain empty. However, Richard Cornelius, who heads the local government branch of Barnet Council, told CNN he \"would rather spend public money bringing family houses back into use than getting involved in battles with the lawyers of billionaires.\""}
{"prompt": "Online abusers have set up Facebook hate pages attacking TV news anchor Reham Khan and her family after it was rumoured that she had married Pakistani politician Imran Khan. News of the potential union sparked outrage in Pakistan and trolls have now accused Ms Khan of being a lesbian for stroking a woman's back, and attempted to shame her for going to parties. Users have blasted her for wearing short skirts, slated her for dancing with unknown men in public, and branded her daughter a 'pornstar' while claiming to be in possession of topless pictures. One image even claims to show Ms Khan in a sex shop in the UK wearing a pink nightdress, with a collar around her neck and a whip slung over her shoulder. Scroll down for video . It was reported that cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan (left), was about to marry TV anchor Reham Khan (right), but his sister now says the news was a lie to damage his reputation in home country Pakistan . Backlash: Hate groups have already sprung up on Facebook where users have been sharing photos of her dancing and going out with friends while making abusive comments . Among the images posted by online abusers was this photograph, which they claim shows Ms Khan in a sex shop, wearing a night dress, suspenders, a collar and with a whip over her shoulder . Anger: The suggestion that Imran Khan could be about to marry Reham Khan, a divorced mother-of-three who used to work at the BBC, has caused outrage in conservative Pakistan . Mr Khan has today said rumours of marriage were 'greatly exaggerated', while his sister Aleema said the family challenged him 'a few days ago' over the news and he denied it. Aleema branded the reports lies, saying they had been concocted by Mr Khan's political enemies to damage his reputation. She told MailOnline: ‘This is the only way the opposition know how to attack him. These are the tactics they would stoop to. It’s out of control. I guess that is politics. ‘I spoke to my brother a few days ago and he said it isn’t true. 'We, the family, just asked him outright, have you married her? And he said no. I don’t know if they are in a relationship, here [in Pakistan] you are either getting married or you are not. ‘We’d be extremely happy if he marries a good person and settles down, of course we would. But it is not just his consideration, it’s a consideration for the country, it’s like a national-level decision. Online trolls have attacked Ms Khan for her appearance, dancing with unknown men, and attending parties . 'There are people in Pakistan who love him so much that everyone wants to participate in his private life, they feel he is their leader and should be part of his decision. ‘Everybody [we, the family] are taken aback at how much other people want to participate in this decision.’ Asked if her brother is in a secret relationship with the TV broadcaster, she said: ‘It’s a confusing signal to everyone who follows him [but] we asked him if he was married and he said no. I don’t know if he is in a relationship. We just asked him if he was married.’ Khan has since tweeted his followers, saying rumors of his marriage are 'greatly exaggerated'. Aleema also appeared in a YouTube video several months ago, alongside Imran's nephew, in which she again said the family had spoken to him about marriage, and he told her it was 'not the right time'. However sources close to both Reham and Imran have suggested they are in a relationship - but that Imran has now distanced himself from her amid political recriminations. A former staffer at the TV station where Reham is now an anchor said the pair used to meet any hour of the day or night without restrictions, . A producer at the station said Reham had 'very good access' to Imran, while his political party knew about the meetings and never tried to stop them. A family friend of Reham Khan, who wished not to be named said: ‘She had an affair some time back but it finished very quickly. 'Later, we learned that she was very serious with Imran Khan and there was news that Imran felt the same. 'But, I think after realising that he would be trapped in another problem, Imran has now put some distance between them.’ The online trolls have attempted to shame Ms Khan for wearing short skirts on TV and appearing to have wrinkles in some shots . Ms Khan, a divorced mother-of-three, was a BBC weather girl but is now a news anchor of AAJ TV . Aleema Khan  says the rumour was started by opposition politicians in Pakistan in order to damage her brother's reputation, but could not say whether he was in a secret relationship (file image) Imran's ex-wife Jemima Goldsmith revealed in October that she was ditching the surname ‘Khan’ and reverting to her family name because her ex-husband was about to remarry. She said at the time: ‘My ex-husband, Imran, recently announced that he intended to get remarried soon, which made me think it’s probably time to change my name back to Goldsmith.’ Another well-known news anchor in Pakistan, Farhat Javed Rabani, Tweeted on December 27: ‘Ahmmm... an anchor has married a politician today... ‪#WeddingBells’ Leading political commentator Dr Shahid Masood, who is a close friend of Imran Khan, said on television that Imran neither confirmed nor denied the news. He added that members of Imran’s political party, Tehreek-e-Insaf, confirmed that Reham wants to get actively get involved with his politics and sees herself a future first lady. Reaction to the rumoured marriage has been very negative in Pakistan and there has been a backlash on social media. Photos of Reham in revealing clothes and a video of her doing a tango while working for the BBC are prompting insulting comments in the conservative Islamic country. Aleema said that the family would be happy if Khan married a 'good person' but that the whole country would participate in the decision . Imran Khan, pictured left, has been single since he divorced Jemima Goldsmith, pictured right, 10 years ago . Rival political parties are jumping on the negative reaction and believe it will harm his credibility to marry a divorcee with an apparently chequered past. Reham, who was born in Libya to Pakistani parents, has three children from her previous marriage to a doctor. Khan's Tehreek-e-Insaf party currently holds the third largest bloc of seats in the country's parliament, but has accused the ruling Pakistan Muslim League and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of vote-rigging, and argue they should have more. In the past Khan has launched personal attacks on Mr Sharif, calling for the embattled leader, who won the 2013 general election by an apparent landslide, to resign."}
{"prompt": "More than one month after a police officer fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, the case continues to provoke public unrest and remains far from settled. The white police officer's shooting of the unarmed black teenager in the St. Louis suburb is being robustly debated and investigated. Where does the criminal investigation stand? So far, there have been no charges filed, but the investigation is ongoing. A St. Louis County grand jury is investigating and hearing testimony into Brown's killing and whether Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson should be charged or not. The grand jury will look at two issues: was a crime committed and is there \"probable cause\" that the accused person -- namely Wilson -- committed that crime. The grand jury, which meets in secrecy, consists of nine white people (six men and three women) and three black people (two women and a man), court officials said. Grand jurors began meeting last month, and their progress on reaching a decision isn't public information, though it's expected to take two months. St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch is the prosecutor presenting evidence to the grand jurors. What is the U.S. Justice Department doing? Federal officials are conducting two civil rights investigations, one into Brown's killing and the other into Ferguson Police Department's overall track record with minorities. One investigation is looking into the August 9 shooting by Wilson, a 28-year-old officer with six years of experience, including four in Ferguson. A civil rights violation would require that Wilson had shown \"racial hostility\" against Brown in the shooting, legal analysts say. The U.S. Justice Department also announced a second inquiry this month to examine accusations that the police department as a whole practiced racial profiling and heavy-handed tactics. \"People consistently expressed concerns stemming from specific alleged incidents, from general policing practices and from the lack of diversity on the Ferguson police force. These anecdotal accounts underscore the history of mistrust of law enforcement in Ferguson that has received a good deal of attention,\" U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said earlier this month. \"Our investigation will assess the police department's use of force, including deadly force. It will analyze stops, searches and arrests. And it will examine the treatment of individuals detained at Ferguson's city jail,\" Holder said. The second investigation typically looks at possible reforms for a law enforcement agency, rather than punishing past alleged misconduct, analysts say. How long will the two federal probes take? They will likely require lots of time, if similar past cases are any indication. For example, the U.S. Justice Department took five years in its investigation of whether Cincinnati police Officer Stephen Roach, who is white, violated the civil rights of Timothy Thomas, 19, who was black and fatally shot by Roach, the Cincinnati Enquirer reported. As in the Brown case, the killing of Thomas ignited riots in Cincinnati in 2001, but the Justice Department announced in 2006 that Roach didn't violate Thomas' civil rights, the newspaper reported. When investigating an entire police department, the Justice Department investigation can easily take a year or more, according to a 2013 report by the Police Executive Research Forum that's entitled, \"Civil Rights Investigations of Local Police: Lessons Learned.\" For example, in 1994, the U.S. Justice Department investigators took a year to investigate the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Police Department for civil right abuses, the research forum said. By 1997, Pittsburgh entered into a consent decree in which the city would identify problematic police behavior and collect data on officers' conduct. In 1999, the Los Angeles police officers in the Rampart division were accused of misconduct and later convicted of \"an array of crimes that included unprovoked shootings and beatings,\" the research forum said. By 2001, Los Angeles police entered into a consent decree to make reforms over five years, but a federal judge became displeased with the progress of reforms and he extended the decree five more years, amounting to a total of 12 years of federal oversight, the forum said. In all, more than 25 police department have experienced some form of U.S. Justice Department intervention the past two decades, and \"some later investigations and reform processes have taken 10 years or more,\" the police forum said. What is Ferguson doing to address community anger? In the aftermath of street riots following the shooting, the Ferguson City Council has tried to soothe public outrage, but at a council meeting this month, the first since the Brown shooting, the gallery turned raucous. Residents chanted Brown's name and shouted at council members, according to media reports. Nonetheless, the council gave the first reading of a proposed ordinance to create a citizen review board to work with the police department. The proposal must undergo another public reading at a subsequent meeting, and then the council can vote on it, city officials said. Some critics have found the measure inadequate. The proposed citizen board is \"a step in the right direction,\" but \"it is very weak\" in terms of how complaints against police would be filed, said John Gaskin, a member of NAACP board. \"At the meeting, very little details were given regarding this board, as to who can sit on it, what type of qualifications they will need, how these people will be elected.\" The day after the September 9 council meeting, dozens of protesters threatened to shut down a portion of Interstate 70 near Ferguson and threw rocks and bottles at police. About three dozen people were taken into police custody after refusing to leave the street, and four were charged with assault on a law enforcement officer."}

Morgan, of Leesburg, is suing the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission for rejecting her request for a vanity license plate reading \"8THEIST,\" according to a formal complaint filed Thursday with the district court. But the commission nixed her request, saying the message \"may carry connotations offensive to good taste and decency,\" according to the complaint. An Americans United for Separation of Church and State legal team is now helping her sue the commission claiming Morgan's First Amendment rights were violated. \"The state of New Jersey is favoring religion while disparaging nonbelief,\" said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of the group. \"It simply has no right to do that.\" Morgan claims that she was denied a license plate for \"8THEIST\" but approved for one that read \"BAPTIST\" and that this \"expresses a preference for theistic religious beliefs, over non-theistic beliefs\" according to the complaint. This case is all too familiar to another New Jersey native, David Silverman, who had to petition for a vanity license plate announcing his atheistic views. After he was initially rejected for a plate reading, \"ATHE1ST,\" Silverman filed a formal complaint with the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission. He says that within three days, a supervisor at the commission issued him the plate. \"The word 'atheist,' in my opinion, is not objectionable,\" Silverman, who is president of American Atheists, told CNN. \"It's not a bad word and shouldn't be regarded as a bad word.\" He takes issue with the process, saying that it's problematic that atheists have to jump through hoops only to be denied, then have to appeal before their license plates get approved.

{"prompt": "A female gray wolf from the Northern Rockies traveled hundreds of miles into northern Arizona, marking the species' first appearance in the region in more than 70 years and the farthest journey south, wildlife officials confirmed Friday. A wolf-like animal had been spotted roaming the North Rim of the Grand Canyon and the adjacent national forest since last month. Biologists collected its scat and sent it to a University of Idaho laboratory for testing, verifying what environmentalists had suspected based on its appearance and a radio collar around its neck. This photo from the Arizona Game and Fish Department shows a gray wolf that was spotted north of the Grand Canyon in northern Arizona. Wildlife officials have confirmed the presence of the first gray wolf in northern Arizona in more than 70 years. 'The corroboration is really good to get,' said Michael Robinson of the Center for Biological Diversity. Biologists don't know the wolf's age or from where it traveled. The radio collar wasn't transmitting a signal, and cold weather forced biologists to suspended efforts to capture the animal and replace the collar. The Idaho lab might be able to glean more details about the wolf from its DNA, but U.S. Fish and Wildlife spokesman Jeff Humphrey said that could take several weeks or months. 'We'll let this wolf be a wolf where it's at, and if it decides it's going to move back north, it can do that,' he said. 'Or if somebody joins her, then that's nature taking its course.' Analysis of the animal's scat shows it's from a Northern Rockies population. The wolf is believed to have traveled at least 450 miles into northern Arizona, where it's been spotted at the Grand Canyon and the adjacent forest . Wolves often roam vast distances in search of food and mates. But the farther they go, the less likely they are to find a mate, said Ed Bangs, who led recovery efforts for wolves in the Northern Rockies over two decades before retiring from the Fish and Wildlife Service in 2011. 'It's looking for love,' he said. 'It leaves the core population and doesn't know the love of its life is going to be right over the next hill, so it just keeps traveling.' About 25 percent of the roughly 1,700 wolves from the Northern Rockies are being tracked, wildlife officials said. They are distinguished from the Mexican gray wolves found in the Southwest by their more full bodies and less pointed ears. Mike Jimenez with the Fish and Wildlife Service in Wyoming said Northern Rockies gray wolves are hard-wired to disperse and have traveled hundreds of miles. One young female started off in Montana and traveled 3,000 miles over six months, making stops in Wyoming, Idaho, Utah and Colorado before it died, he said. Colorado had been the farthest journey south for the animals until the female was confirmed in Arizona, he said. Wolves from another major population in the western Great Lakes have likewise been found far from home. Wolves largely were exterminated early last century across the lower 48 states, except in the western Great Lakes area. The Northern Rockies population was restored after 66 gray wolves from Canada were relocated to central Idaho and Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming in the mid-1990s. They've been absent from the Grand Canyon region since the 1940s. The Fish and Wildlife Service in recent years lifted federal protections for the animals in the western Great Lakes and the Northern Rockies. A federal judge recently ordered the protections re-instated in Wyoming after wildlife advocates sued. Environmentalists are pressing for continued protection of gray wolves. Meanwhile, they celebrated the news of the one in northern Arizona. 'I wonder if she has any sense of the celebrity she has achieved,' said Drew Kerr of WildEarth Guardians."}

A yellow warning for rain was also issued with 'heavy and persistent' downpours predicted in parts of southern Scotland, Northern Ireland, northern England and Wales from Friday afternoon until Saturday morning. Forecasters said between 20mm (0.8in) and 40mm (1.6in) could fall 'quite widely' across the warning area, while some places could see more than 60mm (2.4in) with much of the rain falling within a few hours. Making a splash: A 'super-pod' of more than a thousand dolphins was  spotted off the coast of pembrokeshire - as they swim further inland to feed and raise their young . Experts at The Sea Trust counted the mass off the Pembrokeshire coast in the Bristol Channel. They say the pod is at least a thousand strong but admit it could be an under-estimate as they are impossible to keep track of . Sailing volunteers on the boat 'Cartlett Lady' were surrounded for nearly three hours by 'wall to wall' dolphins as they surveyed a 35 mile stretch . The Met Office said the downpours could lead to surface water flooding, saying: 'The public should be aware of the potential for some localised impacts to travel due to surface water flooding.' It said the high pressure which settled over Britain and protected it from Atlantic depressions in September is in the process of moving - and making room for conditions more in keeping with October. Drivers are being warned of the risk of flash flooding. A man heads out early to the banks o the River Cam in Cambridgeshire for some fishing. Rain is set to sweep in over the South and East of England tomorrow morning . A team of rowers head out for an early morning row on the River Cam while a thin blanket of mist covers the trees in the back ground. The calm scenes are set to come to an end when an Atlantic front moves in across Britain . Enjoy it while it lasts: Temperatures across Britain have remained above average for the beginning of October - but the mercury could plummet by 10C in some parts with the glorious conditions expected to come to an end tomorrow . Forecasters say the high pressure that settled over Britain for much of September is finally moving away and wetter and cooler conditions are set to return . Temperatures could take a plunge in the next few days with forecasters predicting a return to conditions more in keeping with average October weather . University rowers take a breather during an early morning practice session on the River Cam. The scene is a sharp contrast to the weather predicted over the next few days . A cyclist is pictured riding along the banks of the River Cam in Cambridgeshire this morning. Temperatures topped 20C in some parts of Britain today . The sun shines through the trees along the banks of the River Cam as two women enjoy a morning row. Wet weather is set to sweep in from tonight . Darron Burness, head of the AA's flood rescue team, said: 'It's a case of \"change of month, change of weather\". 'After precious little rain in September, autumn will fall sharply into focus tomorrow as it turns wet and windy across many areas. 'While river catchments may well be able to take this volume of water after the very dry September, a lot may fall within 12 to 24 hours, so flash flooding is likely to be the main issue for drivers in the affected areas. Dark clouds gather from the coast off Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire this afternoon with Scotland's Indian summer looking over for the time being after severe winds and rain battered much of the north last night and into this morning . Scotland and northern England is expected to see winds gusting up to 70mph as the fine spell of weather finally comes to an end . 'Be wary of places where water may accumulate; for instance, dips in the road and under bridges. 'In dark, wet conditions, it can be extremely difficult to distinguish between a road that's flooded and one that is simply very wet until it's too late. 'Tomorrow evening's rush hour could be particularly affected, so allow a bit more time if you're heading away for the weekend, and check your car's lights and wiper blades.'"}
{"prompt": "Washington (CNN) -- For more than two centuries, it stood as a silent witness to history -- the \"Arlington Oak,\" a tree that sprouted on land once owned by Robert E. Lee, and later consecrated as part of Arlington National Cemetery. Last weekend, it fell -- one more casualty of the winds and heavy rains from Hurricane Irene. \"It is truly unfortunate to see it's now gone -- that tree had a significant legacy here at Arlington,\" said Steve Van Hoven, the cemetery's urban forester. The Arlington Oak, estimated to be 220 years old, stood by in stoic silence as a nation's history spread out nearby, as the acres filled with the graves of veterans, dignitaries, presidents and the fallen from war after war. For nearly half a century it shaded the area near the graves of members of the Kennedy family who were buried only yards below a slope that leads up to Lee's Arlington House mansion overlooking the Potomac River. According to Arlington National Cemetery, the oak was most known for the role it played in the selection of the grave site for President John F. Kennedy. Kennedy is said to have visited Arlington House -- now a national memorial -- in the spring of 1963 and said the view was so magnificent that he could stay there forever. The Arlington Oak was part of that view. In addition to the Arlington Oak, five other large trees were lost to Irene, including a white oak estimated to be 240 years old, according to the cemetery. Crews have been working since the storm passed to clear debris left from broken branches and smaller trees that were uprooted. It took several days to cut and clean up the trunk and branches of the majestic oak, according to the cemetery."}
{"prompt": "(CNN)  -- Schalke striker Kevin Kuranyi will not be going to the World Cup after Germany coach Joachim Loew publicly ruled out his participation in the finals in South Africa next month. His superb form in the Bundesliga this season, with 18 goals for the title challengers, had led to speculation that the 28-year-old could win a recall to the German squad, which is to be unveiled later this week. \"After full consideration in the training team we came to the conclusion that we have other ideas for the make-up of our World Cup team, both tactically and when it comes to personnel,\" Loew told a press conference on Monday. \"I said this quite openly to Kevin.\" Kuranyi, who has 52 international caps, has not played for Germany since his controversial walkout after being left out of the squad for a World Cup qualifier against Russia in October 2008. Loew vowed never to pick him again, but last month he appeared to soften his stance and said he was mulling over whether to include Kuranyi in his plans. But he insisted that his past indiscretion had nothing to do with his decision to ignore his claims. \"The disciplinary event ... didn't matter to me at the end of the day. It would not have been a problem to have given him another chance in the national team. \"Kevin ... has the character of a consummate professional, in my view.\" Germany will announce their full squad on Thursday and Loew has plenty of striking choice with Bayern Munich pair Miroslav Klose and Mario Gomez, Bayer Leverkusen's Stefan Kiessling and Cacau of Stuttgart pressing for inclusion. The squad will be whittled down to 23 after a training camp in Italy. Kuranyi said he accepted Loew's decision and wished the team well. \"I gave all I could this season on the pitch, but sadly it wasn't enough,\" Kuranyi told AFP. \"But it is the national coach's decision, and I respect and accept it.\""}
{"prompt": "(CNN) -- If Facebook and Wall Street become friends, will you like it? For the past couple of years, the potential for Facebook to go public has been bandied about a lot in tech circles, with more and more of the digital tea leaves suggesting that the social-networking juggernaut will, in fact, one day become a publicly traded commodity. The speculation has heated up again this week. And, amid all the chatter about financial disclosures and initial public offerings, another question has emerged: What would it mean for the average Facebook user? The Wall Street Journal this week quoted unnamed sources who said Facebook is \"inching closer\" to a public offering, in spring or early summer, that would value the company at more than $100 billion. According to the report, Facebook would look to raise a staggering $10 billion during its initial public offering. A $100 billion valuation would price the social-networking giant at more than twice the value of tech institutions such as Hewlett-Packard Co. and 3M Co., the Journal reported. A Facebook spokesman declined to comment for this article. For folks who have followed Facebook's now-iconic rise from dorm-room project to online hangout for more than 800 million users, the money talk may be all well and good. But some of them say they are concerned that, when the stock shares start hitting the market, the ingenuity that built Facebook could disappear. TechCrunch writer Josh Constine wasn't optimistic in a post bluntly titled \"Why Greedy Stockholders and a $100 Billion IPO Could Hurt Facebook.\" Constine argues that if Facebook becomes beholden to stockholders, the site would be less free to innovate and would need to make profit a more important consideration than user experience. In other words, it could mean more ads popping up on users' pages, for example. \"(O)utside stockholders could detract from Facebook's vision and momentum,\" he wrote. \"They could push for faster returns, and pressure the company to display more ads, turn mobile into a direct revenue stream, and play it safe with product. This might produce short-term gains, but could hamper what CEO Mark Zuckerberg has built into a core communications utility for the world.\" Constine cited Facebook changes such as the News Feed. It's hard to fathom now, but in 2006 when the site's centerpiece feature rolled out, it was a radical departure. And people hated it. If short-term stock price had been the site's prime concern then, he says, Facebook may have hesitated to make such a change. \"Changes that disrupt user behavior and ask people to be more open might cause temporary stock price dips (stockholders) don't want,\" he wrote. \"Instead, they could turn Facebook into Microsoft, slowing innovation and making it vulnerable to more agile competitors.\" At ReadWriteWeb, Marshall Kirkpatrick had a more upbeat take, writing that a Facebook flush with new cash could be good for innovation. \"Why? Because the Facebook IPO could mean more and bigger startup acquisitions, more support for more startups and an infusion of smart money and experience into radically new tech experiments.\" Kirkpatrick notes that Facebook's IPO documents would detail how it plans to spend the money it raises. \"If the company signals then that more and bigger acquisitions are an important part of its strategy, that alone will be good news for startups,\" he wrote. Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst with Forrester Research who specializes in online commerce, has a take that jibes with some of both arguments. \"The biggest con of going public is quarterly investor scrutiny and the pressure that puts on short-term goals,\" she told CNN. \"The biggest pro is generally the liquidity it offers shareholders, including employees, but in Facebook's case, that may not be such a big benefit as the shares are already being exchanged in the private market.\" In a financial landscape dominated by quarterly earnings reports, she said it wouldn't be enough for Facebook to make money. To keep Wall Street happy, it would continually have to make more money than it did the quarter before. \"The impact on users is that Facebook will face significant pressure to grow quarter over quarter -- that may degrade the user experience if the way to achieve that is to blast more useless ads to users,\" she said. \"The biggest challenge for Facebook over time will be to continue to engage users and not alienate them.\" And about that $100 billion price tag? She says it's not out of the question. \"Even Groupon, which is horribly unprofitable and has a questionable business model, has a market cap now more than $10 billion,\" she said. \"Is Facebook worth 10 times that? Yes, because it makes much more money than Groupon, has far fewer employees, a stronger management team and a clear target market in display advertising. \"On the other hand, is Facebook worth more than Google, or a third of Apple? That remains to be seen. We're not exactly in a rational market right now.\""}
